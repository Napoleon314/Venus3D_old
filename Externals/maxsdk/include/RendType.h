// DESCRIPTION: Values for specifying the desired type of render to a renderer.

#include "buildver.h"

//! \brief Used to specify the desired type of render when opening a renderer 
//! using Interface::OpenCurRenderer.
/*! The following 3 types are not passed into plugin renderers:
	RENDTYPE_REGION_SEL, RENDTYPE_CROP_SEL and RENDTYPE_BLOWUP_SEL.
	Their purpose is for passing to the function Interface::OpenCurRenderer, 
	which converts them into RENDTYPE_REGION, RENDTYPE_REGIONCROP and RENDTYPE_BLOWUP, respectively.
	The latter 3 are passed into renderers with the region dimensions specified
	by the system according to the bounding boxes of the selected objects.
	These are related to values in RenderUIType enum, but their values do not 
	necessarily match. RendType and RenderUIType are not directly interchangeable.
	Please note that RENDTYPE_BAKE_SEL, RENDTYPE_BAKE_ALL, RENDTYPE_BAKE_SEL_CROP are not 
	supported by OpenCurRenderer.  If used they will act as if RENDTYPE_NORMAL has been used.
