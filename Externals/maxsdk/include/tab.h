// DESCRIPTION: Declaration of a generic "table" class
// AUTHOR: Dan Silva, September 13, 1994
//***************************************************************************/


/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A Generic "Table" class.      
	
	(DSilva 9-13-94)

	This is a type-safe variable length array which also supports list-like
	operations of insertion, appending and deleting.  Two instance variables
	are maintained: "nalloc" is the number items allocated in the
	array; "count" is the number actual used. (count<=nalloc).
	Allocation is performed automatically when Insert or Append operations
	are performed.  It can also be done manually by calling Resize or Shrink.
	Note: Delete does not resize the storage: to do this call Shrink().  
	If you are going to do a sequence of Appends, it's more efficient to 
	first call Resize to make room for them.  Beware of using the Addr 
	function: it returns a pointer which may be invalid after subsequent 
	Insert, Append, Delete, Resize, or Shrink operations.  
	
	
	The implementation minimizes the storage of empty Tables: they are
	represented by a single NULL pointer.  Also, the major part of the
	code is generic, shared by different Tabs for different types of items.

//! \brief Generic container class.
/*! This is a type-safe variable length array class which also supports list-like 
operations of insertion, appending and deleting. Two instance variables are maintained: 
nalloc is the number items allocated in the array; count is the number actual 
used (count<=nalloc). Allocation is performed automatically when Insert or Append 
operations are performed. It can also be done manually by calling Resize() or Shrink().

\note Delete does not resize the storage: to do this call Shrink(). If you are 
going to do a sequence of Appends, its more efficient to first call Resize() to 
make room for them. Beware of using the Addr() function: it returns a pointer which 
may be invalid after subsequent Insert(), Append(), Delete(), Resize(), or Shrink() 
operations.

\note In 3ds max 1.x, the method SetCount(n) will set the count to n, but will not 
assure that only n items are allocated. To do that you should call Resize(n). 
This sets the number allocated. It will also make sure that count<=numAlloc. 
To make sure that exactly n are allocated and that count = n, call both Resize(n) 
and SetCount(n). In 3ds max 2.x and later using SetCount() will also effectively 
call Resize().

\note This structure is not meant to support more than 2G items; if you need to
have more items, consider using an STL container which does not have the	2G 
barrier and is most likely more optimized than this version.

The implementation minimizes the storage of empty Tables: they are represented by 
a single NULL pointer. Also, the major part of the code is generic, shared by 
different Tabs for different types of items.

Tabs may be used on the stack, i.e. they may be declared as a local variable of 
a function or method. You can set the number of items in the table, work with 
them, and then when the function returns, the destructor of the Tab is called, 
and the memory will be deallocated.

Tabs are only appropriate for use with classes that don't allocate memory. 
For example, Tab<float> is fine while Tab<MSTR> is problematic (MSTR is the class 
used for strings in 3ds max). In this case, the MSTR class itself allocates memory 
for the string. It relies on its constructor or destructor to allocate and free 
the memory. The problem is the Tab class will not call the constructors and destructors 
for all the items in the table, nor will it call the copy operator. 
As an example of this, when you assign a string to another string, the MSTR class 
does not just copy the pointer to the string buffer (which would result in two items 
pointing to the same block of memory). Rather it will allocate new memory and copy 
the contents of the source buffer. In this way you have two individual pointers 
pointing at two individual buffers. When each of the MSTR destructors is called it 
will free each piece of memory. So, the problem with using a Tab<MSTR> is that when 
you assign a Tab to another Tab, the Tab copy constructor will copy all the items 
in the table, but it will not call the copy operator on the individual items. 
Thus, if you had a Tab<MSTR> and you assigned it to another Tab<MSTR>, you'd have 
two TSTRs pointing to the same memory. Then when the second one gets deleted it 
will be trying to double free that memory.

So again, you should only put things in a Tab that don't allocate and deallocate 
memory in their destructors. Thus, this class should not be used with classes that 
implement an assignment operator and or destructor because neither are guaranteed 
to be called. The way around this is to use a table of pointers to the items. 
For example, instead of Tab<MSTR> use Tab <MSTR *>. As another example, Tab<int> 
is OK, while Tab<BitArray> would be no good. In the BitArray case one should use 
class pointers, i.e. Tab<BitArray *>.

All methods of this class are implemented by the system except the compare function 
used in sorting (see Sort()).
