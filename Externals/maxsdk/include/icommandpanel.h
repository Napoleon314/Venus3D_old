	The threshold (which defaults to 50 pixels) affects the way rollups are
	placed when the command panel is resized (from one to multiple columns). A
	number of rollups remain in the left column while others move over to the
	second and/or additional columns based on this. A lower threshold will
	increase the likelihood that a panel gets shifted over to the next column.
