	line segment defined by the world space points <b>p0</b> and <b>p1</b>
	represent a segment of volume that needs to be shaded. This line segment is
	a line along the ray defined by the line between the viewer's eye (the
	camera) and the pixel being rendered in the image plane and continuing
	through world space. This ray is broken up into segments, with the
	boundaries defined by surfaces. If there are no surfaces, there will just
	be a single segment from the eye point going off into space (<b>p1</b> will
	be a large number). If there is a surface that is hit, and the surface is
	opaque, there will still be one segment from the eye to the surface. If the
	surface is transparent there may be two segments, the segment before and
	the segment after. Therefore the ray may be broken up into many segments
	depending on the number of transparent surfaces hit.\n\n
	The shader does not need to be directly concerned with this however. It
	only knows it's shading the segment between <b>p0</b> and <b>p1</b>. It
	will get called repeatedly for different pixels and different segments.\n\n
	The output of this method is the computed <b>color</b> and
	<b>trans</b>parency.\n\n
	An example implementation of this method is 3ds Max's Simple Fog. It takes
	the distance of the line segment and essentially interpolates towards the
	fog color based on the distance. This is a very simple effect.\n\n
	3ds Max's Volume Fog traverses along the segment and evaluates its 3D noise
	function. It integrates the density across the segment, and uses the
	density to compute the fog color.
	\par Parameters:
	<b>ShadeContext\& sc</b>\n\n
	The ShadeContext.\n\n
	<b>const Point3\& p0</b>\n\n
	The start point of the segment to shade. This point (and <b>p1</b>) are in
	an undefined 'internal' space specific to the renderer (which for the 3ds
	Max renderer is in fact is camera space). To get to world space the plug-in
	would call <b>sc.PointTo(p0,REF_WORLD)</b>.\n\n
	<b>const Point3\& p1</b>\n\n
	The end point of the segment to shade.\n\n
	<b>Color\& color</b>\n\n
	This method shades the volume between p0 and p1 and modifies this
	color.\n\n
	<b>Color\& trans</b>\n\n
	This method shades the volume between p0 and p1 and modifies this
	transparency.\n\n
	<b>BOOL isBG=FALSE</b>\n\n
	TRUE if the background is being shaded; otherwise FALSE. If TRUE then p1
	will be infinity (a large number). This is used when the option to not fog
	the background is on. */

\par Description:
This is the plug-in class from which developers sub-class their Anti-aliasing
filters. These filters appear in the Render Scene dialog in the Anti-Aliasing
section in the Filter dropdown list.\n\n
Filter are a very simple plug-in as there are only a few methods that define
them. The <b>KernelFn()</b> method is the one that does the filtering. The
other methods are simply informational.\n\n
A filter kernel is nothing but a curve that starts (usually at 0) at some
distance R from a center pole. This curve is swept around the center pole
forming a volume that is centered at the center of a pixel (0.5,0.5) and
extends to cover some of the near neighboring pixels. The height of this filter
"hat" gives the weight for each pixel under the filter. To achieve high
resolution and good quality this convolution is done at full 8x8 sub-pixel
resolution: each subpixel is weighted by the height of the curve above it. This
is what the KernelFn() method returns. It is given the distance from the center
pole and it returns the weight. This is the only method that computes
anything.\n\n
Note: When things get rasterized in 3ds Max it is done so at a resolution
higher than that of the final output raster. 3ds Max actually rasterizes the
geometry to an 8x8 raster <b>within each</b> pixel. This mask is used do hiding
and shading operations properly <b>inside</b> each pixel. Each of these 64
inside-a-pixel pixels is called a subpixel.\n\n
Theoretically, the <b>KernelFn()</b> function could get called once for each
sub-pixel with the distance of the center of that subpix to the center pole. Of
course that would take a great deal of time. Instead 3ds Max builds a table at
the beginning of a render. This table is slow to build (it requires many calls
to <b>KernelFn()</b>) but fast to use and gives <b>exactly</b> the same answer
as doing the computationly intense approach at the sub-pixel level. Thus the
<b>KernelFn()</b> function can be fairly slow yet the render still happens
relatively fast.
