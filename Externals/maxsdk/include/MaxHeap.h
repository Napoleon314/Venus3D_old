// Undefine possible new and delete macros, so they won't break our operators declarations. For instance, a debug
// macro for new could look like this: "#define new _debug_new(__FILE__, __LINE__)". In the MaxHeapOperators class,
// we would obtain something like this: "UtilExport static void* _new_debug_new(__FILE, __LINE__)( size_t size );",
// and it wouldn't compile.
#undef new
#undef delete

//! \brief The base class in Max that controls the memory management for any class that derives from it.
/*! The sole purpose of this class is to provide various overloads of the new and delete operators. By doing this, any 
class that derives from this class and doesn't implement it's own new and delete operators will see all of its memory
operation go through the Max Core. Doing this permits plugins to easily benefit from the same memory allocation
optimizations the Max Core has or will receive in the future. It also permits plugins linked with a different CRT than 
the Max Core to safely pass memory pointers to heap blocks allocated on one side of the plugin dll boundary and 
deallocated on the other.

If a plugin class has to implement its own new and delete operators but also derive indirectly from MaxHeapOperators,
access to the new and delete operators will have to be disambiguated. For an example on how to do this with a "using" 
declaration, see the class MaxWrapper in maxsdk\\include\\maxscrpt\\maxobj.h.
