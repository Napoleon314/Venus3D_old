This structure is used by the Network Rendering API to store global 
server state information.\n\n
If <b>hJob</b> is a valid handle (i.e. non 0) and <b>frame</b> holds a <b>NO_FRAME</b>,
this means this server has just be assigned a job or it is in between
frames (no frames assigned). Most likely it is loading 3ds Max. The
transition in between frames is in the nanosecond level, but seeing
as it is possible, it cannot be discarded.
