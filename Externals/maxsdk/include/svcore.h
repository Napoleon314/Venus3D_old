/** This is the callback object used to perform the [de]selection via
 * Animatable:: SvGetMultiSelectCallback().
 * Schematic view supports multiple selection. When the user selects a set of
 * objects in the schematic view and then "transfers" that selection set to the
 * rest of max (either by having "synchronize selection" on or by manually moving
 * the selection out), there are a number of ambiguities that can arise. For
 * example, some of the objects in the schematic view cannot be selected in the
 * viewports, material editor, or modifier stack. Another example: the material
 * editor only supports one active material/map but many materials and maps can be
 * selected simultaneously in the schematic view. The "MultiSelectCallback" system
 * exists order to handle these cases and to handle selection synchronization
 * between SV and future editors in 3ds Max. When the schematic view attempts to
 * synchronize selection by moving the SV selection set to the "outside" world, it
 * follows this procedure:\n\n
 * 1. First SV calls SvGetMultiSelectCallback() on all the visible SV nodes to
 * "collect" MultiSelectCallback objects. Objects that want to synchronize their
 * selection state with the schematic view (not a common or trivial operation --
 * this is really more associated with adding a new editor in 3ds Max rather than
 * adding new plug-in) return a pointer to a static instance of a
 * MultiSelectCallback derived object. There is only one instance of a
 * MultiSelectCallback per editor. Furthermore, if an editor displays objects of
 * many classes, all the classes should override SvGetMultiSelectCallback() to
 * return the same MultiSelectCallback instance. This implies that, as far as the
 * schematic view is concerned, there is never more than one primary editor class
 * associated with any particular object class (currently, viewports for nodes,
 * material editor for materials and maps and the modifier panel for
 * modifiers).
 * For example, here is the code in BaseNode that returns the MultiSelectCallback
 * instance for nodes (this is the MultiSelectCallback used for viewports):
\code
class BaseNodeMSelCB : public MultiSelectCallback
{
	private:
		bool clear;
		BaseNodeTab selNodeTab;
		BaseNodeTab deselNodeTab;

		int Priority() { return 1000; }
		void Begin(IGraphObjectManager *gom, bool clear);
		void Select(IGraphObjectManager *gom, IGraphNode *gNode, bool isSelected);
		void End(IGraphObjectManager *gom);
};
static BaseNodeMSelCB baseNodeMSelCB;
MultiSelectCallback* BaseNode::SvGetMultiSelectCallback(IGraphObjectManager *gom, IGraphNode *gNode)
{
	return &baseNodeMSelCB;
}
\endcode 
2. For each selection class (unique MultiSelectCallback instance), the
schematic views calls "Begin()". This is the spot where any "pre-selection"
preparation takes place. The order that the MultiSelectCallback instances are
called in is determined by their priority. The priority is returned by the
"Priority()" method. MultiSelectCallback's with a higher priority (lower value)
are called before those with a lower priority (higher value). For example, here
is the Begin associated with the viewports:
\code
void BaseNodeMSelCB::Begin(IGraphObjectManager *gom, bool clear)
{
	this->clear = clear;
//
// If the "clear" bool is true, the current viewport selection set is cleared...
//
		if (clear)
		GetActiveSelSet()->Clear(FALSE);
//
// Some housekeeping in preparation for the select...
//
	selNodeTab.Resize(0);
	deselNodeTab.Resize(0);
}
\endcode 
 * 3. For each of objects in the schematic view whose selection state is changing,
 * the object's MultiSelectCallback instance is retrieved (again) and the "Select"
 * method is called. Here is where the actual selection/de-selection work can take
 * place. I say "can" because, in practice, the select method usually just
 * collects all the objects to be selected and all the objects to be deselected
 * into lists which are then processed in the "End()" method. This is simply
 * for performance -- it is often more efficient to set the selection state of a
 * group of objects all at once. Here's the "Select()" method from
 * BaseNode:
\code
void Select(IGraphObjectManager *gom, IGraphNode *gNode, bool isSelected)
{
	BaseNode *baseNode = (BaseNode *) gNode->GetAnim();

	if (isSelected) {
		if (!baseNode->IsRootNode() && !baseNode->IsFrozen()
			&& !baseNode->IsHidden())
			selNodeTab.AppendNode(baseNode, FALSE);
	}
	else {
		if (baseNode->Selected())
			deselNodeTab.AppendNode(baseNode, FALSE);
	}
}
\endcode 
 * 4. Finally, for each selection class (unique MultiSelectCallback instance), the
 * schematic views calls "End()". This is the spot where any "post-selection"
 * operations take place. For example, here is the "End()" for the BaseNode
 * (viewports):
\code
void End(IGraphObjectManager *gom)
{
	if (selNodeTab.Count() > 0 || deselNodeTab.Count() > 0) {
		theHold.Begin();
		if (selNodeTab.Count() > 0)
			GetActiveSelSet()->SelectMultiple(selNodeTab, FALSE);

		if (deselNodeTab.Count() > 0)
			GetActiveSelSet()->DeselectMultiple(deselNodeTab, FALSE);

		theHold.Accept(getResMgr().getString(IDS_SV_SELECT, appInst));
		RedrawViewports(GetCOREInterface()->GetTime(), VP_DONT_SIMPLIFY);
	}
	else {
		if (clear)
			RedrawViewports(GetCOREInterface()->GetTime(), VP_DONT_SIMPLIFY);
	}
}
