\par Description:
This is the base class for the creation of Sampler plug-ins which work with the
Standard material. These appear in the Super Sampling rollout in the Sampler
dropdown. They have an Enable checkbox and a Quality spinner for their user
interface. An optional modal dialog may also be presented.\n\n
A Sampler is a plug-in that determines where inside a single pixel the shading
and texture samples are computed. For some Samplers this pattern is the same
for each pixel, for others a different pattern is chosen for each pixel. After
determining the sample locations, the sampler calls back to the renderer to
compute the shading values. It then averages the resluting shading values and
returns its estimate of the final color.\n\n
Some Samplers are adaptive. This means that the Sampler decides on-the-fly how
many samples to take to achieve its goal. There are many subtleties to adaptive
Samplers and many ways to define the adaptive mechanism. The adaptive mechanism
used by the R3 Samplers is very simple: take 4 samples, look for the maximum
change in any of the color channels, if it's greater than the threshold, then
sample the entire pixel according to the given quality. Threshold is an
optional parameter that may, but need not be used by adaptive Samplers.\n\n
The transfer of control from 3ds Max to the Sampler plug-in is as follows: A
Sampler is responsible for the sampling loop. It samples until it is done and
computes the sum of its samples upon completion. Once the Sampler's
<b>DoSample()</b> method is called 3ds Max no longer has control. This is how
adaptive samplers are handled. The <b>DoSample()</b> routine will determine how
often and where it samples, then it calls the provided
<b>SamplingCallback::SampleAtOffset()</b> method to have 3ds Max compute the
shading value.

		/*! \remarks This is the method where the Sampler plug-in does its sampling
		loop. Upon completion it returns the color and transparency back to 3ds Max in
		<b>c</b> and <b>t</b>.\n\n
		A sampler samples a range of 0.0 to 1.0. For a pixel sampler this range gets
		mapped to a single pixel. The sampler doesn't need to be concerned with this
		however. It just works within the 0.0 to 1.0 space determining where to put the
		samples. Essentially, this method generates a set of points and calls
		<b>SamplingCallback::SampleAtOffset()</b> for each one. Then it sums up the
		results of the values returned from <b>SampleAtOffset()</b>, divides by the
		number of samples, and stores the results in <b>c</b> and <b>t</b>.
		\par Parameters:
		<b>ShadeOutput* pOut</b>\n\n
		This is the output of the sampling.\n\n
		<b>SamplingCallback* cb</b>\n\n
		This is the callback provided by 3ds Max which the sampler uses to actually do the sampling.\n\n
		<b>ShadeContext* sc</b>\n\n
		The Shade Context which provides information about the pixel being sampled.\n\n
		<b>MASK mask=NULL</b>\n\n
		The 64 bit pixel mask. This mask coresponds to the 8x8 sub-pixel area grid. The
		actual geometry covers only some portion of these bits. This is essentially an
		8x8 raster for the inside of the pixel where bits are set over the polygon
		being rendered and bits are off for areas not over the polygon. Developers
		typically only want to sample where the geometry is and thus when the bits are
		on. If not the results are very poor visually.\n\n
		Note: Most polygons are quite small in a typically complex scene being
		rendered. In other words, most polygons that need to get sampled will only have
		a small number of these mask bits on since the polygons are very small relative
		to the pixel. For instance, edge on polygons may project down to only a few
		bits within the pixel. Consequently it is quite possible that there may be zero
		samples, i.e. no geometry in the mask. Developers need to check for this zero
		samples condition. If this is the case then a method of <b>ShadeContext</b>
		called <b>SurfacePtScreen()</b> is used. This method returns a point which is
		guaranteed to be on the fragment no matter how small it is. This point can then
		be used for at least a single sample.
		\par Sample Code:
		The following is a brief analysis of the <b>DoSamples()</b> method from the
		Uniform Sampler of 3ds Max. This sampler sub-divides the sample area into a
		grid and samples the pixel at the center point of each grid unit.\n\n
		This code is from the file
		<b>/MAXSDK/SAMPLES/RENDER/SAMPLERS/STDSAMPLERS.CPP</b>.\n\n
		The complete code is shown below and then a code fragment analysis follows:\n\n
		\code
		void UniformSampler::DoSamples( ShadeOutput* pOut, SamplingCallback* cb, ShadeContext* sc, MASK mask ) {
			int sideSamples = GetSideSamples();
			DbgAssert( sideSamples > 0 );
			// we map 0...sideSz into 0..1
			float sideSzInv = 1.0f / float(sideSamples);
			float sampleScale = texSuperSampleOn ? sideSzInv : 1.0f;	
			Point2 samplePt;
			float nSamples = 0.0f;
			pOut->Reset();
			ShadeOutput sampOut( sc->NRenderElements() );

			// Sampling Loop
			for( int y = 0; y < sideSamples; ++y ) {
				samplePt.y = (float(y) + 0.5f) * sideSzInv;
				for( int x = 0; x < sideSamples; ++x ) {
					samplePt.x =  (float(x) + 0.5f) * sideSzInv;
					if ( sampleInMask( samplePt, mask, sc->globContext->fieldRender ) ) {
						// returns true for unclipped samples
						if (cb->SampleAtOffset( &sampOut, samplePt, sampleScale )) {
							(*pOut) += sampOut;
							nSamples += 1.0f;
						}
					}
				}
			} // end, sampling loop

			if ( nSamples == 0.0f ) {
				// gets center of frag in screen space
				samplePt = sc->SurfacePtScreen(); 
				cb->SampleAtOffset( pOut, samplePt, 1.0f );
			} 
			else {
				pOut->Scale( 1.0f / nSamples );
			}
		}
		\endcode
		The above code is broken into smaller fragments to look at below:\n\n
		\code 
			int sideSamples = GetSideSamples(); 
		\endcode
		Here the sampler is just getting the number of sides in the sampling grid. This
		is computed based on the Quality spinner in the user interface. In this sampler
		this results in a number between 2 and 6 (developers can look at the
		<b>UniformSampler::GetSideSamples()</b> method to see this). Thus the resulting
		sampling grid is 2x2 or 3x3, up to 6x6. Then the number of samples is computed
		by multiplying the number of sides times itself.\n\n
		\code 
			int numSamples = sideSamples * sideSamples;
		\endcode
		Next the side size inverse is computed to know how big the step size is. This
		is the amount to step along each time.\n\n
		The sample scale is how large is the piece that's being sampled. For example,
		if the grid is 2x2 then each sample is scaled by 1/2\n\n
		\code 
			float sideSzInv = 1.0f / float(sideSamples);
			float sampleScale = texSuperSampleOn ? sideSzInv : 1.0f;
		\endcode
		Next the number of samples, and the color and transparency are initialized to	zero:\n\n
		\code
			float nSamples = 0.0f;
			pOut->Reset();
			ShadeOutput sampOut( sc->NRenderElements() );
		\endcode
		Then the sampling loop begins. Here the positions of individual sampling points
		are computed. Each point is then checked to see if it corresponds to a point in
		the mask (is over a polygon). (The <b>sampleInMask</b> function is defined in
		<b>/MAXSDK/SAMPLES/RENDER/SAMPLERS/SAMPLERUTIL.CPP</b>). If it is a point
		that's over a polygon then <b>SampleAtOffset()</b> is called. What
		<b>SampleAtOffset()</b> does is turn the passed 2D sample into a 3D sample and
		fills out a ShadeOutput with a color and transparency. These returned values are 
		summed up over the sampling loop (<b>(*pOut) += sampOut;)</b>.\n\n
		\code
			for( int y = 0; y < sideSamples; ++y ) {
				samplePt.y = (float(y) + 0.5f) * sideSzInv;
				for( int x = 0; x < sideSamples; ++x ) {
					samplePt.x =  (float(x) + 0.5f) * sideSzInv;
					if ( sampleInMask( samplePt, mask, sc->globContext->fieldRender ) ) {
						// returns true for unclipped samples
						if (cb->SampleAtOffset( &sampOut, samplePt, sampleScale )) {
							(*pOut) += sampOut;
							nSamples += 1.0f;
						}
					}
				}
			}
		\endcode
		At the end of the sampling loop a check is done to see if there were zero
		samples. This is the case if the geometry is very small relative to the pixel.
		There are two approaches that one might take when there are zero samples. One
		is to simply return black. A strict 'jitter-type' sampler might do this since,
		in fact, no samples were hit. This will result in artifacts to the image
		however. A better approach is to use the <b>ShadeContext</b> method
		<b>SurfacePtScreen()</b> to return a point which is guaranteed to be at the
		center of the fragment. Then this point is passed to <b>SampleAtOffset()</b> so
		a single sample which is on the fragment is used.\n\n
		If a single sample point was used, <b>DoSamples()</b> is finished. The reults
		are in <b>pOut</b> as returned from	<b>SampleAtOffset()</b>.\n\n
		If a number of samples was taken, the shade info is scaled by the inverse of the 
		number of samples (<b>nSamples</b>) to get the final colors.\n\n
		\code
			if ( nSamples == 0.0f ) {
				// gets center of frag in screen space
				samplePt = sc->SurfacePtScreen(); 
				cb->SampleAtOffset( pOut, samplePt, 1.0f );
			} 
			else {
				pOut->Scale( 1.0f / nSamples );
			}
		\endcode
