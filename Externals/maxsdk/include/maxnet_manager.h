\par Description:
The MaxNetManager class provides all the methods to interact with the network
rendering functions provided and acts as your primary interface. The API
provided through the MaxNetManager allows clients to connect to the Network
Rendering Manager and perform any and all functions available. It encapsulates
all the networking details leaving the client code to concentrate on whatever
it needs to do. The API handles all networking code and the intricacies of the
communication protocols used by the lower layers. This class is derived from
the MaxNet class which is solely used for exception handling as shown
below.\n\n
\par Sample Code:
<b>try {</b>\n\n
<b>// the code being tried</b>\n\n
<b>} catch (MaxNet* maxerr) {</b>\n\n
<b>// handle the error</b>\n\n
<b>// do NOT delete maxerr</b>\n\n
<b>// use maxerr-\>GetErrorText() to get the error description</b>\n\n
<b>// use maxerr-\>GetError() to get the error code</b>\n\n
<b>}</b>
