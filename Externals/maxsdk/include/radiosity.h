 * Radiosity Interface class

/*! \sa Class ObjLightDesc, Class RadiosityInterface, Class IRadiosityEffectExtension,  Class NodeDisplayCallback,  Class IRadiosityPreferences\n\n
\par Description:
This class is only available in release 5 or later.\n\n
The class provides the interfaces for creating Advanced Lighting plug-ins in
3ds Max. RadiosityEffect plug-ins are controlled through the Advanced Lighting
dialog from the render menu.\n\n
A RadiosityEffect behaves as a light in the scene. An implementation of
RadiosityEffect must also provide an implementation of ObjLightDesc, to be
returned from RadiosityEffect::CreateLightDesc(). This ObjLightDesc is then
used by the renderer to apply the radiosity light during a render.\n\n
The architecture is designed to support scene based lighting solvers (which use
a precalculated solution), as well as image based solvers (which calculate
their solution at render time). The method RunProcess() and its relatives,
StopProcess(), AbortProcess(), and WaitForCompletion() are called by the system
to request processing of a scene based solution. Image based solvers only need
stub implementations of these methods.\n\n
A RadiosityEffect can use a NodeDisplayCallback to
control the viewport display of scene geometry. In particular, it is possible
for a lighting solution to be displayed interactively in the viewport if the
NodeDisplayCallback provides geometry with appropriate vertex illumination.\n\n
A RadiosityEffect may want to reference objects in the scene to detect events
which invalidate its lighting solution. A problem arises that the
RadiosityEffect can become inundated with reference messages, so to address
this problem the RadiosityEffect should ignore any message where the
PART_EXCLUDE_RADIOSITY flag is set in the PartID of the message. Any message
where ((partID|PART_EXCLUDE_RADIOSITY)!=0) is an event that the system deems
should not invalidate the radiosity, for example, when texture display in
viewport is turned on or off.\n\n
See also IsInterestedInChannels() in
Class IRadiosityEffectExtension.\n\n
All methods of this class are virtual.\n\n */
