\par Description:
This is a list of face "clusters" for a given mesh. A typical application would
be in Edit(able) Mesh, where the user has selected two separate groups of faces
on different parts of the mesh and wants to extrude them both, or rotate both
around their local centers. Each "cluster" is a contiguous group of selected
faces. Like AdjEdgeLists and AdjFaceLists, this class is only defined in
relation to some mesh.\n\n
This class may be used to group faces together based on the angle between their
normals or by their selection status.\n\n
All methods of this class are implemented by the system. Note that the
functionality provided by this class is not available in the 1.0 release of the
SDK. Later releases (1.1, 1.2, etc) do support it.
\par Data Members:

<b>UNDEFINED</b> for their id.\n\n

<b>clust[i]</b> is <b>UNDEFINED</b> if face <b>i</b> is not in any cluster (ie
is unselected).\n\n
<b>DWORD count;</b>\n\n
The number of clusters.  */

	// This version separates cluster also using a minimum angle and optionally the selection set
	/*! \remarks Constructor. This version separates clusters using a minimum
	angle and optionally the selection set. A developer creates one of these
	cluster lists by specifying the mesh, the face list and an angle. What is
	built is a cluster number for each face identifying what cluster it is
	in.\n\n
	For example, if you create one of these for a sphere and set the angle
	threshold to 90 degrees, you would get back one cluster, and the cluster id
	for everything would be 0. If you ran it on a box, and you set the angle to
	\< 90 degrees, you would get back 6 ids. Two faces in the box would have id
	0, two would have id 1, etc.
	\par Parameters:
	<b>Mesh *mesh</b>\n\n
	The mesh to create the list for.\n\n
	<b>AdjFaceList\& adj</b>\n\n
	The face list for this mesh.\n\n
	<b>float angle</b>\n\n
	The maximum angle (in radians) that can be used in joining adjacent faces
	into the same cluster.\n\n
	<b>BOOL useSel</b>\n\n
	If FALSE, selection is ignored and all faces are grouped into clusters by

	still relevant. Non-selected faces will have <b>UNDEFINED</b> for their id.

	/*! \remarks Constructor. This version separates clusters using the

	selected and are adjacent. For example you could have a sphere with some
	faces selected on one side, and another group of faces selected on the
	other side. Each group of adjacent and selected faces would comprise
	clusters within the mesh. This is used for example by the axis tripods in

	clusters (ie none of the faces that use it are in any clusters), vclust[v]
	is UNDEFINED.\n\n
	In cases where a vertex is in two clusters, the larger face index is
	dominant. (In other words, if a vertex 6 is on faces 2 and 7, which are in
	two separate clusters, and face 9, which isn't in any cluster, it gets its

	instance in the faces that make up the letter "o" in a ShapeMerge with
	Text, both boundaries are returned in no particular order.
	\par Parameters:
	<b>DWORD clustID</b>\n\n
	The cluster to get the border of.\n\n
	<b>AdjFaceList \&af</b>\n\n
	The adjacent face list associated with this FaceClusterList.\n\n
	<b>Tab\<DWORD\> \&cbord</b>\n\n
	The table where the output goes. If there are no borders (as for instance
	in a sphere with all faces selected), it remains empty. Otherwise, this is
	filled with a series of edge indices, then an UNDEFINED to mark the end of
	each border. So for instance if this cluster represents the front face of a
	default box, cbord will contain 4 edge indices and an UNDEFINED. If the
	cluster represents all the side faces of a cylinder, but not the top or
	bottom, there are two borders: on 24-sided cylinder, you'd get the 24 edge
	indices representing the bottom lip of the cylinder, then an UNDEFINED,
	then the 24 edge indices representing the top lip, followed by another
	UNDEFINED. (As elsewhere, edges are indexed by face*3+eid, where face is
	the face (in the cluster) the edge is on, and eid is the index of the edge
	on that face.) */

	/*! \remarks	This creates "outline" directions for the vertices on the edge of the
	clusters. These are used in Edit(able) Mesh's new "Bevel" operation (when
	you Bevel by "Group"). These vectors, which are all perpendicular to the
	cluster normals, point in the direction and speed vertices must travel in
	order to move the edges out at a consistent rate without changing the shape
	of the outline of the cluster.\n\n
	To see how this works, create a Prism in 3ds Max ("Extended Primitives")
	with dimensions like 20 x 40 x 40 x 40, and apply an Edit Mesh. Select all
	the faces on the top of the prism, and spin the Bevel spinner up and down.
	Notice that the vertex at the sharpest point moves faster than the other 2,
	but that the edges all remain parallel to their original positions. The
	essence of Outlining is that the edges move at a constant rate, and the
	vertices move faster or slower to make this happen. (This strategy is also
	used in the Bevel and Path Bevel modifiers.)

\par Description:
This class contains all the data needed to move points as the user drags a
chamfer. It's created by the topological change that happens at the start of
the chamfer. It is used to maintain chamfer information between several
<b>MeshDelta</b> methods. The strategy is this: The chamfer operation is
divided into two parts, the topological change and a later geometric change.
(This works well for EditableMesh, where the topology change is completed
first, then apply a series of geometry changes as the user spins a spinner or
drags a mouse. Each geometry change is undone before the next is applied, but
the topology change only happens once.)\n\n

\par Description:
This is a class for caching winged edge lists, face adjacency lists, face and
edge clusters, vertex normals, and other derived data about a mesh.\n\n
There is a <b>SetMesh()</b> method to set the current mesh that the TempData is
based on, then there's a series of methods to update the cache and return some
sort of derived data. All of these methods follow the form:
\code DerivedData *MeshTempData::DData (parameters); \endcode
DerivedData is the container for the derived data requested (often a simple
table, though there are some specialized classes returned from some methods).
If the data has already been computed, the parameters are ignored and the
cached data is returned. Otherwise, the data is computed from the parameters
and the current mesh.\n\n
There are no procedures in place to detect changes in parameters or the mesh
since the last time a method was called, so it's the calling routine's
responsibility to free invalid structures. If you know that only certain
pipeline channel, such as <b>GEOM_CHANNEL</b>, have changed, you can use the
<b>Invalidate(ChannelMask channels)</b> method. (<b>GEOM_CHANNEL</b> would free
the distances-to-selected-vertices, for example, but not the <b>Adjacent Edge
List</b>.)\n\n
In particular, there is no way for the <b>MeshTempData</b> to know when its
mesh pointer is no longer valid, so it's vital that the calling routine clear
the mesh (with <b>SetMesh(NULL)</b>) or stop using the <b>MeshTempData</b> when
this happens.\n\n
All data members are private. They basically consist of a series of pointers
which are initialized to NULL and then filled with allocated derived data as
requested. There is also a NULL-initialized, private mesh pointer which is set
with <b>SetMesh()</b>.\n\n
Editable Mesh and Edit Mesh both use this class to hold all the varieties of
temporary, cached data they create -- examples are vertex normals and face
clusters. This is called "ETTempData" in Editable Mesh and "EMTempData" in Edit
Mesh.\n\n
To use MeshTempData, just set it to your mesh and start asking for stuff:\n\n
<b>MyAlgorithm (Mesh *m) {</b>\n\n
<b>MeshTempData mtd(m);</b>\n\n
<b>// Get Adjacent Edge List.</b>\n\n
<b>AdjEdgeList ae = mtd.AdjEList ();</b>\n\n
<b>}</b>

/*! \remarks This function is available in release 3.0 and later only.\n\n
This is the standard affect region function, based on a distance and the three
affect region parameters (same as the editable mesh).\n\n
This function is a cubic curve which returns 1 at distance 0, 0 if distance is
greater than falloff, and other values for distance between 0 and falloff. To
"see" this function graphed, look at the curve in the Soft Selection parameters
in Edit Mesh, Editable Mesh, Mesh Select, or Volume Select. This function
currently is constructed as follows:\n\n
\code
float u = ((falloff - dist)/falloff);
float u2 = u*u, s = 1.0f-u;
return (3*u*bubble*s + 3*u2*(1.0f-pinch))*s + u*u2;"
\endcode 
\par Parameters:
<b>float dist</b>\n\n
The distance to the selection. The method for computing this distance is up to
the developer; for example in Mesh Select, it's the distance to the nearest
selected vertex, while in Volume Select (with a box or sphere selection region)
it's the distance to the selection volume.\n\n
<b>float falloff</b>\n\n
The limit distance of the effect. If distance \> falloff, the function will
always return 0.\n\n
<b>float pinch</b>\n\n
Use this to affect the tangency of the curve near distance=0. Positive values
produce a pointed tip, with a negative slope at 0, while negative values
produce a dimple, with positive slope.\n\n
<b>float bubble</b>\n\n
Use this to change the curvature of the function. A value of 1.0 produces a
half-dome. As you reduce this value, the sides of the dome slope more steeply.
Negative values lower the base of the curve below 0.
\return  Returns the strength of the Affect Region function at the given
distance. (In selection modifiers, this is the "soft selection" amount, the
amount it's considered selected. A vertex at a distance with a return value of
.25, for instance, will be affected 1/4 as strongly in a deformation as a fully
selected vertex.) */

<b>alsoHide</b> will NOT WORK, as mesh.vertHide is overwritten before alsoHide
is read.

The mesh to check.\n\n
<b>BitArray \&alsoHide</b>\n\n

hidden. */

/*! \remarks This function is available in release 3.0 and later only.\n\n
This function computes distances from selected vertices (as indicated by
<b>mesh.VertexTempSel()</b>) to non-selected ones.\n\n
NOTE: This is an order-of-n-squared algorithm. Each unselected vert is compared
with each selected vert. So, if you have a mesh with 1000 sel verts and 1000
unsel verts, this involves a million compares.
\par Parameters:
<b>Mesh \& mesh</b>\n\n
The mesh to check.\n\n
<b>float *selDist</b>\n\n
This is assumed to be a float array of size <b>mesh.numVerts</b>. It is set to
-1 for all verts if there is no selection. Otherwise, selected vertices have a
value of 0, and nonselected vertices have the distance to the nearest selected
vertex. */
DllExport void SelectionDistance (Mesh & mesh, float *selDist, float falloffLimit = -1.0f);
/*! \remarks This function is available in release 3.0 and later only.\n\n
This function computes distances from selected vertices (as indicated by
<b>mesh.VertexTempSel()</b>) to non-selected ones along edge paths.
<b>selDist</b> is assumed to be a float array of size <b>mesh.numVerts</b>.
<b>selDist</b> is set to -1 for all verts if there is no selection. Otherwise,
selected vertices have <b>selDist</b> value 0; non-selected vertices that are
"iters" or fewer edges away from a selected vertex are assigned the shortest
edge-path distance to a selected vertex; and non-selected vertices that are
more than <b>iters</b> edges away are set to -1. The <b>AdjEdgeList</b> is
computed by the algorithm if the one passed is NULL; otherwise you can save
time by passing a cached one in.\n\n
This is NOT an n-squared algorithm like the one above. It's more a sort of
order-of-n-times-(iters-squared).
\par Parameters:
<b>Mesh \& mesh</b>\n\n
The mesh to check.\n\n
<b>float *selDist</b>\n\n
An array of floats of size <b>mesh.numVerts</b>.\n\n
<b>int iters</b>\n\n
If 0, Selection Distance is computed from each vertex to the nearest selected
vertex, regardless of topology. This is a VERY EXPENSIVE ALGORITHM, which takes
almost 4 times as long for twice as many vertices. If iters is non-zero, it
represents the number of edges one should "travel" in trying to find the
nearest selected vertex -- this means that it only takes twice as long for
twice as many verts. (This is like the Edge Distance parameter in EMesh's Soft
Selection dialog.) If iters is 0, ae is irrelevant and may be left as NULL. If
iters is nonzero, an Adjacent Edge List is required, and will be computed
internally from the mesh if ae is NULL. (If you've got an AdjEdgeList for this
mesh handy, pass it in, otherwise don't worry about it.)\n\n
Note also that if iters is nonzero, the distance is computed along the edges,
not directly through space. If there is no selected vertex within an
iters-length path, a vertex is assigned a 0 selection value.\n\n
<b>AdjEdgeList *ae=NULL</b>\n\n
The optional adjacent edge list. */

Computes distances from nonselected vertices in the mesh to each of the vertex
clusters. This is a VERY EXPENSIVE ALGORITHM, which takes almost 4 times as
long for twice as many vertices.\n\n
Preparation for this method would typically look like:\n\n
<b>// given Mesh msh, FaceClusterList fclust:</b>\n\n
<b>Tab\<DWORD\> vclust;</b>\n\n
<b>fclust.MakeVertCluster (msh, vclust);</b>\n\n
<b>Tab\<float\> ** clustDist;</b>\n\n

<b>for (int i=0; i\<fclust.count; i++) clustDist[i] = new Tab\<float\>;</b>\n\n
<b>ClustDistances (mesh, fclust.count, vclust.Addr(0), clustDist);</b>\n\n
Then (*clustDist[c])[v] would give the distance from vertex v in the mesh to
the vertices of cluster c.
\par Parameters:
<b>Mesh \&mesh</b>\n\n
The mesh the clusters are based on.\n\n
<b>DWORD numClusts</b>\n\n
The number of clusters in this mesh.\n\n
<b>DWORD *vclust</b>\n\n
A pointer to an array of vertex cluster IDs. Typically this is a pointer to the
data in the table created by EdgeClusterList::GetVertClusters or
FaceClusterList::GetVertClusters.\n\n
<b>Tab\<float\> **clustDist</b>\n\n
This is an array of \<numClusts\> pointers to tables that will be used to store
distances from various clusters. Each table will be set to the ize of
mesh.numVerts and filled with distances to the cluster that table represents.

/*! \remarks This function is available in release 3.0 and later only.\n\n
Computes distances from nonselected vertices in the mesh to each of the vertex
clusters. Unlike the other version which doesn't have an iters or ae parameter,
this is a linear algorithm which computes distance along a finite number of
edges.\n\n
Preparation for this method would typically look like:\n\n
<b>// given Mesh msh, FaceClusterList fclust:</b>\n\n
<b>Tab\<DWORD\> vclust;</b>\n\n
<b>fclust.MakeVertCluster (msh, vclust);</b>\n\n
<b>Tab\<float\> ** clustDist;</b>\n\n

<b>for (int i=0; i\<fclust.count; i++) clustDist[i] = new Tab\<float\>;</b>\n\n
<b>ClustDistances(mesh, fclust.count, vclust.Addr(0), clustDist);</b>\n\n
Then (*clustDist[c])[v] would give the distance from vertex v in the mesh to
the vertices of cluster c.
\par Parameters:
<b>Mesh \& mesh</b>\n\n
The mesh the clusters are based on.\n\n
<b>DWORD numClusts</b>\n\n
The number of clusters in this mesh.\n\n
<b>DWORD *vclust</b>\n\n
A pointer to an array of vertex cluster IDs. Typically this is a pointer to the
data in the table created by EdgeClusterList::GetVertClusters or
FaceClusterList::GetVertClusters.\n\n
<b>Tab\<float\> **clustDist</b>\n\n
This is an array of \<numClusts\> pointers to tables that will be used to store
distances from various clusters. Each table will be set to the ize of
mesh.numVerts and filled with distances to the cluster that table
represents.\n\n
<b>int iters</b>\n\n
The maximum number of edges to travel along looking for a vertex in the given
cluster.\n\n
<b>AdjEdgeList *ae=NULL</b>\n\n
Edge length computations require an adjacent edge list. If you don't pass one
in this parameter, it'll have to construct its own from the mesh. */

// Mesh Selection Converter Interface - by Steve Anderson, October 2002
// For accurate selections of polygons and elements in Meshes in window region selections,
// (as well as correct by-vertex selections of edges and faces in window regions)
// we need to know not only which components were selected, but also which were culled,
// for instance by virtue of being back-facing.  We want to select only elements in which
// all faces were in the selection region, but we shouldn't eliminate elements just because 
// some of their faces were culled.

// So we provide this Mesh Selection Converter interface, which automatically stores culling
// information in a BitArray when Mesh::SubObjectHitTest is called.  Then this can be used
// to handle level conversions in Editable Mesh, Edit Mesh, and Mesh Select 
// SelectSubComponent routines.
