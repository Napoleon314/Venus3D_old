\par Description:
This class provides an interface into derived objects. Methods of this class
are provided so developers can access the modifier stack, add and delete
modifiers, etc. All methods of this class are implemented by the system.\n\n
To use this interface you must \#include the following file:\n\n
<b>\#include "modstack.h"</b>\n\n
To get an <b>IDerivedObject</b> pointer from the pipeline of a node in the
scene first retrieve the object reference using <b>INode::GetOjbectRef()</b>.
Given this <b>Object</b> pointer check its SuperClassID to see if it is
<b>GEN_DERIVOB_CLASS_ID</b>. If it is, you can cast it to an
<b>IDerivedObject</b>.\n\n
Note: The following functions are not part of class <b>IDerivedObject</b> but
are available for use in conjunction with its methods. */
