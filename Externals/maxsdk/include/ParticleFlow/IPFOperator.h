      /*! \brief Returns true if the operation has been proceeded successfully.
	Methods' signatures are presented in two forms: one is compact, and the other one
	is for function-publishing where PreciseTimeValue is presented as a pair (int,float).
	\param pCont: particleContainer 
	\param timeStart: the time for particle to start from the simulation. Each particle
					may have its own current valid time greater than timeStart. In this
					case the operator should consider the current particle time and 
					timeEnd parameter. Some operators (like Birth) may not consider
					current particle time since it works with timeStart and timeEnd
					parameters only.
	\param timeEnd: the time for particles to come to; each particle may have its
					own current valid time; the parameter sets the time for all
					particles to synchronize to.
					If current particle time is greater than timeEnd it means that the
					particle doesn't require processing at all; the particle has been already 
					updated beyond the interval ]timeStart, timeEnd] of the current operator.
						Sometimes the operator may not be able to proceed all the 
      				particles to the given timeEnd. In this case the operator proceeds 
					the particles as far as possible and set the parameter to the 
      				time achieved. All the following operators will be given the new
					timeEnd value as a time value for particles to come to, 
					and the particle system will run another round of operator stack 
    					modification in the attempt to proceed all the particles to the 
    					initially set time.
	\param pSystem: the particle system that generates the particle stream; 
					the same operator may get calls from different particle systems; if the 
					result varies according to the particle system that generates
					particles, then this parameter is useful.
	\param pNode: INode of the particle system that generates the particles.
	\param actionNode: INode of the operator (if any; can be NULL)
	\param integrator: an operator to proceed particles according to "inertia" rules.
					The operator updates time, speed, position, spin, orientation channels
					on the basis of time, acceleration, speed, angular acceleration and
					spin channels. Each particle system has a default inertia operator.
					When an operator want to update current time for particles, it
					uses the "inertia" operator. An Action in the ActionList stack my "switch"
					the suggested "inertia" operator by its own if the Action support
					the "inertial" operator interface. The particle system recognizes
					such an Action as a holder of "inertia" interface, and use it
					for "inertia" purposes later on.
					If the parameter is NULL then the particle system doesn't allow 
					the operator to advance particles in the time channel.
