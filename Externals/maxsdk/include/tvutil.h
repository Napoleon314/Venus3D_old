	DESCRIPTION: Track view utility plug-in class

	CREATED BY:	Rolf Berteig

	HISTORY: 12/18/96
    03/11/02 -- Adam Felt.  Expanded the interfaces.  
	
	WARNING: Plugin compatibility is not preserved between R4.x and R5 
	for TrackviewUtility plugins.  R4.x TrackViewUtility plugins need 
	to be recompiled before running on R5.x and later.  R5 and later 
	plugins will not run properly on previous versions.

\par Description:
This is the base class for Track %View Utility plug-ins. These plug-ins are
launched via the 'Track %View Utility' icon just to the left of the track view
name field in the toolbar. Clicking on this button brings up a dialog of all
the track view utilities currently installed in the system. Most utilities will
probably be modeless floating dialogs, however modal utilities may be created
as well.\n\n
The developer will derive their classes from this class. Methods are provided
to bracket the beginning and ending of parameter editing, and responding to
various changes in Track %View (such as key selection, time selection, node
selection, etc.). There is also a method to delete this instance of the plug-in
class. Sample code is available in
<b>/MAXSDK/SAMPLES/UTILITIES/RANDKEYS.CPP</b>, <b>ORTKEYS.CPP</b> and
<b>SELKEYS.CPP</b>. \n\n
\par Plug-In Information:
Class Defined In: TVUTIL.H \n
Super Class ID:   TRACKVIEW_UTILITY_CLASS_ID \n
Standard File Name Extension: DLU \n
Extra Include File Needed: None \n
