 * interactive renderer will not know how to render the Shader in the viewports.
 * Developers of this plug-in type also need to have an understanding of how the Standard 
 * material and the Shader work together.
 * Every material has a Shader. The Shader is the piece of code which controls how
 * light is reflected off the surface. The Standard material is the mapping mechanism which 
 * handles all the texturing for the material. Managing the user interface is also done by 
 * the standard material. This way the Shader plug-in needs only to worry about the interaction 
 * of light on the surface.\n\n
 * Prior to release 3, developers could write Material plug-ins that performed
 * their own shading. However, this was usually a major programming task. Release 3
 * provides the simpler Shader plug-in that would benefit from sharing all the
 * common capabilities. The Standard material, with its 'blind' texturing
 * mechanism, makes this possible. It doesn't know what it is texturing - it
 * simply textures 'stuff'. The shader names the channels (map), fills in the
 * initial values, and specifies if they are a single channel (mono) or a triple
 * channel (color). The Standard material handles the rest including managing the
 * user interface.
 * The main part of the code in a Shader is responsible for supplying this information to a
 * Standard material. The values are passed and received back in class IllumParams.
 * There is a specific method named Illum() in a shader, which actually does the shading.

		* Some of the key parts of this method are discussed below:\n\n
 		* The <b>is_shiny</b> line sets a boolean based on if the Shader has a
		* shininess setting \> 0. Note that the Blinn shader uses the same
		* channel ordering as the original Standard material so it can index its
		* channels using the standard ID <b>ID_SS</b>.\n\n
		* <b>BOOL is_shiny= (ip.channels[ID_SS].r \> 0.0f) ? 1:0;</b>\n\n
		* Next the 'Phong Exponent' is computed. This is just a function that is
		* used to give a certain look. It uses 2^(Shinniness *10) * 4. This
		* calculation simply 'feels right' and gives a good look.\n\n
		* <b>double phExp = pow(2.0, ip.channels[ID_SH].r * 10.0) * 4.0;</b>\n\n
		* The following loop sums up the effect of each light on this point on
		* surface.\n\n
		* <b>for (int i=0; i\<sc.nLights; i++) {</b>\n\n
		* Inside the loop, the light descriptor is grabbed from the
		* ShadeContext:\n\n
		* <b>  l = sc.Light(i);</b>\n\n
		* The <b>LightDesc::Illuminate()</b> method is then called to compute
		* some data:\n\n
		* <b>  if (l-\>Illuminate(sc,ip.N,lightCol,L,NL,diffCoef))
		* {</b>\n\n
		* To <b>Illuminate()</b> is passed the ShadeContext (<b>sc</b>), and the
		* normal to the surface (<b>ip.N</b>) (pointing away from the surface
		* point).\n\n
		* The method returns the light color (<b>lightCol</b>), light vector
		* (<b>L</b>) (which points from the surface point to the light), the dot
		* product of N and L (<b>NL</b>) and the diffuse coefficient
		* (<b>diffCoef</b>). The diffuse coefficient is similar to NL but has the
		* atmosphere between the light and surface point taken into account as
		* well.\n\n
		* The next piece of code checks if the light figures into the
		* computations:\n\n
		* <b>   if (NL\<=0.0f)</b>\n\n
		* <b>    continue;</b>\n\n
		* If NL\<0 then the cosine of the vectors is greater than 90 degrees.
		* This means the light is looking at the back of the surface and is
		* therefore not to be considered.\n\n
		* The next statement checks if the light affect the diffuse channel
		* (lights may toggle on or off their ability to affect the diffuse and
		* specular channels.)\n\n
		* <b>   if (l-\>affectDiffuse)</b>\n\n
		* <b>    ip.diffIllumOut += diffCoef *
		* lightCol;</b>\n\n
		* If the light affects the diffuse channel then the diffuse illumination
		* output component of the <b>IllumParams</b> is added to. This is done by
		* multiplying the diffuse coefficient (returned by
		* <b>LightDesc::Illuminate()</b>) times the light color (also returned by
		* <b>LightDesc::Illuminate()</b>). Notice that the <b>diffIllumOut</b> is
		* being accumulated with each pass of the light loop.\n\n
		* The next section of code involves the specular component. If the light
		* is shiny, and it affects the specular channel a vector <b>H</b> is
		* computed.\n\n
		* <b>   if (is_shiny\&\&l-\>affectSpecular) {</b>\n\n
		* Note the following about this <b>H</b> vector computation. Most vectors
		* are considered pointing <b>from</b> the point on the surface. The view
		* vector (<b>IllumParams::V</b>) does not follow this convention. It
		* points from the 'eye' towards the surface. Thus it's reversed from the
		* usual convention.\n\n
		* <b>H</b> is computed to be the average of <b>L</b> and <b>V</b>. This
		* is <b>(L+V)/2</b>. Since we normalize this we don't have to divide by
		* the 2. So, if <b>V</b> followed the standard convention this would be
		* simply <b>L+V</b>. Since it doesn't it is <b>L+(-ip.V)</b> or
		* <b>L-ip.V</b>.\n\n
		* <b>    Point3 H = Normalize(L-ip.V);</b>\n\n
		* Next the dot product of <b>N</b> and <b>H</b> is computed and stored in
		* <b>c</b>. When you take the dot product of two normalized vectors what
		* is returned is the cosine of the angle between the vectors.\n\n
		* <b>    float c = DotProd(ip.N,H); </b>\n\n
		* If c\>0 and the diffuse coefficient is less than the soften threshold
		* then <b>c</b> is modified by a 'softening' curve.
		* \code
		if (c>0.0f)
		{
			if (softThresh!=0.0 &&
			diffCoef<softThresh) {
				c *=
					Soften(diffCoef/softThresh);
			}
		}
		\endcode  
		Note that the <b>Soften()</b> function is defined in
		<b>/MAXSDK/SAMPLES/MATERIALS/SHADERUTIL.CPP</b> and developers can copy
		this code.
		\code
		c = (float)pow((double)c,phExp);
		\endcode 
		Next, <b>c</b> is raised to the power of the Phong exponent. This is
		effectively taking a cosine (a smooth S curve) and raising it to a
		power. As it is raised to a power it becomes a sharper and sharper S
		curve. This is where the shape of the highlight curve in the Materials
		Editor UI comes from.\n\n
		That completes the pre computations for the specular function. Then
		<b>c</b> is multiplied by the specular strength
		(<b>ip.channels[ID_SS].r</b>) times the light color (<b>lightCol</b>).
		The result is summed in specular illumination out
		(<b>ip.specIllumOut</b>).\n\n
		\code
		ip.specIllumOut += c * ip.channels[ID_SS].r * lightCol;
		\endcode 
		That completes the light loop. It happens over and over for each
		light.\n\n
		Next the self illumunation is computed. If the Self Illumination Color
		is not on, then the original code for doing mono self illumination is
		used.
		\code
		// Apply mono self illumination
		if ( ! selfIllumClrOn )
		{
			float si = ip.channels[ID_SI].r;
			ip.diffIllumOut = (si>=1.0f) ? Color(1.0f,1.0f,1.0f)
				:
			ip.diffIllumOut * (1.0f-si) + si;
		}
		else
		{
		// Otherwise the self illumination color is summed in to the Self Illumination 
			Out (ip.selfIllumOut).
		// colored self illum,
			ip.selfIllumOut += ip.channels[ID_SI];
		}
		\endcode 
		* Then, we multiply by the colors for ambient, diffuse and specular.\n\n
		\code
		ip.ambIllumOut *= ip.channels[ID_AM];
		ip.diffIllumOut *= ip.channels[ID_DI];
		ip.specIllumOut *= ip.channels[ID_SP];
		\endcode 
		* The results are <b>ambIllumOut</b>, <b>diffIllumOut</b>, and
		* <b>specIllumOut</b>. Note that these components are not summed. In R3
		* and earlier these results would be returned to the Standard material.
		* However, R4 introduces a couple extra steps.\n\n
		* Finally, we call <b>ShadeTransmission()</b> and
		* <b>ShadeReflection()</b> to apply the transmission/refraction and
		* reflection models. The core implementation of 3ds Max provides the
