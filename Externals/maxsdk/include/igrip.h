//! \brief A pure virtual interface for implementing grips.
/*! A Grip or Caddy is a collection of modeless, transparent, in canvas UI elements that lets a user perform actions or modify values.  A user can create their
own grip by inheriting from IBaseGrip, implementing IBaseGrip's pure virtual functions, and then enable it on via the IGripManager interface. 
Based upon the number of grip items the grip contains and the type each item is, the system will create a set of in canvas UI representations for each
item, which then interact with the IBaseGrip item via various functions.  Usually the implementation of the IBaseGrip acts as a bridge between some existing data
and the in canvas UI. For example if a grip was created to modify different soft selection values in a modifier, the grip would get the values from that 
modifier and then set the values back onto it.  The grip itself will get displayed via the IGripManager::EnableGrip function which basically calls various IBaseGrip
functions to set up the in canvas UI and then ferry messages to and from the UI to the grip.
\see IGripManager.  There are a collection of implemented grips present in the sdk at maxsdk\samples\mesh\editablepoly\polygrips.h, polygrips.cpp
