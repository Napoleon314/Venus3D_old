// STEVE: MeshDeltas and/or MapDeltas lack the following clever features:
// - Realloc amounts: currently we realloc arrays with no extra room for growth (dv especially).

// These classes encompass the notion of a "Mesh Edit".  They are the principal means
// of keeping track of what's going on in the Edit Mesh modifier, and have many standard
// mesh edits available for use elsewhere.

// Principle is that, while these work as designed on the right mesh, they will give
// some result on the wrong mesh.

// Order of operations:
// Verts/TVerts/CVerts created or cloned.
// Faces created -- indices correspond to original vert list, then create, then clone.
// Face attributes & indices changed.
// Verts & faces deleted.

// "Channels" of data in MeshDelta -- different from GEOM_CHANNEL type channels!

VDataDelta is a way for a MeshDelta to keep track of per-vertex information.
Like vertex selection, this information is explicitly set after all topological
changes performed by the MeshDelta, so any active vertex data channels are
always set to the size <b>outVNum()</b> for the related <b>MeshDelta</b>.
An example of this being used is in Edit Mesh, where you can assign or modify
vertex weights. All these changes and assignments are stored in the Edit Mesh's

\par Description:
This class represents the notion of a mesh edit.
This is an SDK class that represent some kind of change to a mesh. This "delta"
can include topological, geometric, map, and/or selection changes. Most
standard mesh "edits" available in the Editable Mesh or Edit Mesh interface are
available through the MeshDelta SDK, giving developers a powerful way to
manipulate meshes while not having to "sweat the details" of maintaining maps
to match the mesh changes, updating edge selections, etc.
The MeshDelta members and methods make use of a number of mesh-related classes, including Class FaceChange, Class FaceRemap, Class FaceSmooth, Class VertMove, Class UVVertSet, Class MapDelta, Class VDataDelta, Class AdjEdgeList, Class AdjFaceList, Class MeshChamferData.
While we often talk about the characteristics of the "input mesh" that a
MeshDelta is based on, all MeshDeltas should be able to cope with any mesh.
Note: You must <b>\#include "MESHDLIB.H"</b> to use this class as it's not
included by default by <b>MAX.H</b>.
\par Method Groups:
See <a href="class_mesh_delta_groups.html">Method Groups for Class MeshDelta</a>.
\par Data Members:
<b>DWORD vnum</b>
The expected number of vertices in the input mesh.
<b>DWORD fnum;</b>
The expected number of faces in the input mesh.
<b>Tab\<VertMove\> vMove;</b>
This data member stores movements of input vertices. Each VertMove consists of
a vertex ID indicating which vertex should be moved and a Point3 offset in
object space. VertMoves are stored in vertex ID order, and there is never more
than one VertMove per original vertex.
<b>Tab\<VertMove\> vClone;</b>
If the vClone[i] record has a vid of UNDEFINED, it's considered a "create", and
the coordinates of vClone[i].p are considered to be in object space. If
vClone[i].vid is not undefined, it's the index of a vertex "original" in the
input mesh, and vClone[i].p is treated as an offset from that vertex. If the
vertex is not present in the input mesh, i.e. vClone[i].vid \>= mesh::numVerts,
the clone will not be created in the output. All creates and clones are stored
in the order created..
<b>BitArray vDelete;</b>
This data member stores deletions of vertices in the input mesh. vDelete's size
is vnum.
<b>Tab\<FaceCreate\> fCreate;</b>
This data member stores faces newly created as part of the MeshDelta. These are
stored in the order created.
<b>Tab\<FaceRemap\> fRemap;</b>
This data member stores changes in which vertices are used by existing faces.
See class FaceRemap for more information. These are stored in original face
order, and there is never more than one per original face.
<b>Tab\<FaceChange\> fChange;</b>
This data member stores changes in input face characteristics, such as material
ID, edge visibility, and face hiding. See class FaceChange for more
information. These are stored in original face order, and there is never more
than one per original face.
<b>Tab\<FaceSmooth\> fSmooth;</b>
This data member stores changes in input face smoothing groups. See class
FaceSmooth for more information. These are stored in original face order, and
there is never more than one per original face.
<b>BitArray fDelete;</b>
This data member stores deletions of faces in the input mesh. The size of this
BitArray is fnum.
<b>BitArray vsel;</b>
This data member stores the vertex selection of the output mesh.
<b>BitArray esel;</b>
This data member stores the edge selection of the output mesh. As with class
Mesh's edgeSel data member, this information is indexed by side of face:
esel[ff*3+k] is the edge selection for face ff, side k.
<b>BitArray fsel;</b>
This data member stores the face selection of the output mesh.
<b>BitArray vhide;</b>
This data member stores the vertex hide information of the output mesh.
<b>MapDelta *map;</b>
Points to an array of MapDeltas which maintain any relevant changes to the
various map channels. The size of this array is always equal to
mapSupport.GetSize().
<b>BitArray mapSupport;</b>
Indicates which maps are supported by this MeshDelta.
<b>VDataDelta *vd;</b>
Points to an array of VDataDeltas which maintain any relevant changes to the
various vertex data channels. The size of this array is always equal to
vdSupport.GetSize().
<b>BitArray vdSupport;</b>
Indicates which vertex data channels are supported by this MeshDelta.  */

This class provides a standard interface for modifiers and objects that use

Both Edit Mesh and Editable Mesh have a current "state", which can be modified
by MeshDeltas. In Editable Mesh, this "state" is an actual mesh, while in Edit
Mesh, this is one <b>MeshDelta</b> per <b>LocalModData</b>. This class provides

   subclasses from both of them.
   There's essentially one mesh that can be edited per

   mesh. ApplyMeshDelta typically handles adding Restore objects (if
   theHold.Holding()), clearing out any temporary local caches that are

/*! \remarks This global function is available in release 3.0 and later
only.
Finds a triangulation of an n-sided polygon using vertices in the specified
mesh. As long as the vertices are coplanar, this algorithm will find a proper
triangulation, even for nonconvex polygons.
\par Parameters:
<b>Mesh \&m</b>
The mesh containing the vertices used in the polygon.
<b>int deg</b>
The size of the polygon.
<b>int *vv</b>
The vertex indices of the polygon, in order around the perimeter. For instance,
if deg is 5 and w points to an array containing (3, 6, 8, 0, 7), the polygon is
presumed to have the outline described by m.verts[3], m.verts[6], m.verts[8],
m.verts[0], and m.verts[7].
<b>int *tri</b>
This is where the output is placed. Note that this should point to an array of
size at least (deg-2)*3, to hold all the triangles. The values placed in this
array are indices into the w array -- that is, given a 5-sided polygon, one
triangle in this list might be (0,2,3), indicating you should use the 0th, 2nd,
and 3rd elements of w to form the triangle. Put another way, to make a face
from the n'th triangle given by this array, you would set:
<b>f.v[0] = w[tri[n*3+0]];</b>
<b>f.v[1] = w[tri[n*3+1]];</b>
<b>f.v[2] = w[tri[n*3+2]];</b> */
