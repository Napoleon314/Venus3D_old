/** This interface enables material and texture map plugins to display textures in the new viewport 
	display system in 3ds Max 2012. Developers override the ITextureDisplay::SetupTextures() method to assign 
	a texture resource to the ISimpleMaterial managed by the material or texture map plug-in.

	In general materials have a more complicated requirement for texture display. An example would be diffuse and opacity display 
	with different mapping channels.  Texture plugins on the other hand tend to be more simplistic. However, there are examples of a more complex setup 
	as can be seen with the mix or composite maps.  To support these complex setups a plugin must implement ITextureDisplay, otherwise
	during translation GetActiveTexHandle() will be called.

	The texture resource is represented by the TexHandle class and can be created using TexHandleMaker::CreateHandle().  
	The TexHandle instance lifetime is managed by the plugin. If the texture data managed by a plug-in (e.g. texture 
	related parameters) becomes invalid then the plug-in must deleted the TexHandle and to call ISimpleMaterial::ClearTextures(). It is 
	possible to clear a single texture resource by calling SetTexture() with NULL and the appropriate map usage.
