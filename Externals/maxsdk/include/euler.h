/*! \note This class is only available in release 5 or later. 

This class is to hold different representations of the rotation. In particular,
it holds rotation value as represented by Euler angles or quaternion. Different
types of rotation controllers may use different representations. To avoid
losing information due to converting from one representation to another, we can
use RotationValue to hold the result.\n\n
For example, the Skin pose feature reads rotation of a node from the rotation
controller and stores the result in RotationValue (c.f.
maxsdk/include/iSkinPose.h).\n\n
\code
// Assuming node is a valid pointer to INode.
ISkinPose* skpose = ISkinPose::GetISkinPose(*node);
// skpose should not be null for Max version 5.0 or later.
RotationValue rv = skpose-\>SkinRot();
\endcode
It is guaranteed that rv keeps the original representation of the
controller.\n\n
Being asked of Euler angles, RotationValue will return 3 float numbers in the
format of Point3. There must be an association between numbers and axes.\n\n
There are two classes of Euler angle types. In one class, the rotation axes are
not repeated (non-repetitive). They are enum's from kXYZ to kZYX. In the other
class, one of the rotation axes is repeated (repetitive). They are enum's from
kXYX to kZXZ. For convenience, enum kReptd is used to denote the starting one:
kRept == kXYX.\n\n
For non-repetitive Euler angles, there are two well-defined methods to
associate three ordered angles, to three axes.\n\n
First, we can associate angles with x-, y-, and z-, axes, respectively. The
first angle, for example, is always associated with the x-axis, no matter where
it appears in the Euler order. Suppose\n\n
<b>Point3 a(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)</b>\n\n
then a.x (==0.1), a.y(==0.2), a.z (==0.3), are the angles of the x-axis,
y-axis, and z-axis, respectively, no matter whether the order (type) of the
Euler angles is kXYZ or kZXY.\n\n
Let's call this way of association by axis (name).\n\n
Second, we can associate them by position: the first angle, from left, is
always associated with the first axis in the Euler angle order. For examples,
the first angle is applied to the x-axis for kXYZ and kXZY, but to the y-axis
for kYXZ and kYZX, etc. Suppose a is a Point3, a[0] (==a.x), a[1] (==a.y), a[2]
(==a.z), are the angles of the z-axis, x-axis, and y-axis, respectively, for
Euler type kZXY.\n\n
Let's call this way of association by order.\n\n
For repetitive Euler type, the association by axis is ambiguous because one
axis may appear twice in the Euler axes. In this case, "by order" is well
defined.\n\n
This class uses the association of by axis for non-repetitive types and by
order for repetitive type. Suppose,\n\n
<b>Point3 a = rv.Euler(RotationValue::kZXZ) // repetitive Euler type</b>\n\n
Then, a[0] and a[2] are both applied to the Z axis, but a[0] corresponds to the
first z-axis from left, a[2] corresponds to the second z-axis (third axis) from
left, and a[1] corresponds to the x-axis.\n\n

class RotationValue: public MaxHeapOperators {
//
// There are two classes of Euler angle types, that of which rotation
// axes are not repeated, from kXYZ to kZYX, and one of which an axis is
// repeated, from kXYX to kZXZ. Repeated types starts from kReptd.
// For non-repetitive Euler angles, there are two well-defined methods
// to associate three ordered angles, to axes. First, we can associate
// them with x-, y-, and z-, axes in order. The first angle, for example,
// is always associated with the x-axis, no matter where it appears
// in the Euler type (x-axis appears at second place in kZXY, for example).
// Second, we can associate them by position: the first angle is always
// associated with the first axis in the Euler type. For examples,
// the first angle is applied to the x-axis for kXYZ and kXZY, to the
// y-axis for kYXZ and kYZX, etc.
// Let's call the first method by (axis) name, and the second method
// by order. We associate angles by name for non-repetitive Euler types.
// For repetitive types, by-name is not well-defined, because there is
// a missing axis. For repetitive types, we associate angles by-order.
// Example:
//   Point3 a = Euler(RotationValue::kZYX);
// then, a.x, a.y, a.z, are the Euler angles for the x-axis, y-axis,
// and z-axis.
//   Point3 a = Euler(RotationValue::kZXZ);
// then, a.x is angle applied to the first z-axis (from left), a.y is
// applied to the x-axis, and a.z is applied to the second z-axis.
