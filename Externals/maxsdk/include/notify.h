// Notification information structure -- Passed to NOTIFYPROC to inform it what
// it's being notified about...
/*! 3ds Max supports a system where a plug-in can ask to receive a callback
when certain events occur. These are events such as the system unit 
settings changing, system time setting changing, or the user executing 
File/Reset, File/New, etc. \n\n
This structure is part of this system. It is available in release 2.0 
and later only. The Interface class has related methods for registering callbacks. \n\n
The plug-in creates a callback function to process the notification. 
The notification callback function (NOTIFYPROC) is defined as follows:\n
<code>typedef void (* NOTIFYPROC)(void *param, NotifyInfo *info);</code> \n
The NotifyInfo structure is passed to the <b>NOTIFYPROC</b> to inform 
it of what it's being notified about. \n\n
The sample code below shows how this system may be used.
\par Sample Code:
\code
// Declare the callback function
static void TimeUnitsChanged(void *param, NotifyInfo *info)
{
// Handle the units changing...
}
// Register the callback
RegisterNotification(TimeUnitsChanged,this, NOTIFY_TIMEUNITS_CHANGE);

// When done, unregister the callback
UnRegisterNotification(TimeUnitsChanged,this, NOTIFY_TIMEUNITS_CHANGE);
\endcode
\par See Functions:
RegisterNotification(NOTIFYPROC proc, void *param, int code); \n
UnRegisterNotification(NOTIFYPROC proc, void *param, int code); \n
BroadcastNotification(int code); \n
BroadcastNotification(int code, void *callParam); \n
UnRegisterNotification(NOTIFYPROC proc, void *param);
