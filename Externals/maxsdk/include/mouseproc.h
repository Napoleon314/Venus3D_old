/*! \sa  Class MouseCallBack, Class ViewExp, Class Object, Class Interface, Class Point3, Class Matrtix3, Class CreateMouseCallBack.\n\n
\par Description:
This mouse proc allows drawing in multiple viewports, offsetting from the
contruction plane, and orthogonal and angle snapping. This allows developers to
support orthogonal snapping and angle snapping on creation (as the Bezier line
tool does). If the user presses Shift while dragging the mouse, the point is
snapped to the nearest quadrant (ortho snapping). If the Alt key is held, the
point is snapped using the setting of the angle snap system.\n\n
The typical control flow of this class is that the <b>OnPointSelected()</b>
method is called every time the user clicks in the viewport, and
<b>OnMouseAbort()</b> is called when the user right clicks to finish the curve.
<b>RemoveLastPoint()</b> is called when backspace is pressed, and
<b>OnMouseMove(Point3\& p)</b> is called every time the mouse moves (this lets
the developer update the curve continuously).\n\n
This class is a sub-class of MouseCallBack, but it can also be used as a
CreateMouseCallBack to create curves from the creation panel. To do this you
embed a DataEntryMouseProc in a CreateMouseCallBack as show below. Notice the
implementation of the virtual member StartNewCreation(). This is a new virtual
method on CreateMouseCallBack that tells the system whether the mouse proc is
in a state ready to create a new object. This was required, becase the "proc"
function now always returns "CREATE_STOP" in order to implement multi-viewport
input.\n\n

    /*! \remarks This method is called every time the user clicks in the viewport to enter
    data. This is the method in NURBS curves, for example, that adds a new CV
    or point to the curve. The method can query the <b>mMouseClick</b> member
    to see which point this is in the sequence (like the "point" parameter to
    traditional MouseCallback classes), and the 3D value of the point can be
    determined from <b>mPoints[mMouseClick]</b>. The data member <b>mPoints</b>
    contains all the 3D points selected, and <b>mClickPoints</b> is a table of
    the 2d points where the user clicked in the viewport.
    \return  The return value is used to determine whether the creation should
    continue or not. If it returns TRUE, more points are selected. If it
    returns FALSE, then the creation is done. In the case of NURBS, this is
    used to implement the feature that asks users if they want to close a curve
    when they click on the same point where they started the curve. If the
    answer is yes, this method returns FALSE, otherwise it always return TRUE.
