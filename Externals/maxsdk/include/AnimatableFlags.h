/*! \defgroup AnimatableFlags Animatable Flags
Animatable flags are generally meant to be used in enumerations of Animatable 
instances where each instance must be visited only once. The Animatable flags are
in general not persisted, nor copied between instances of class Animatable.
Many of these flags are for internal use only. 

Unique Animatable bit flag values can be requested via Animatable::RequestFlagBit(). 
Plugins are encouraged to use this mechanism over the older <A href="#Animatable_Work_Flags">General Animatable work flags</A>, 
or the <A href="#Animatable_Plugin_Flags">Animatable plugin flags</A>.
