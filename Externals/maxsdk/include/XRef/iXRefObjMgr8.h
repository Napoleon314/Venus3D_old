//! \brief Class for managing object xrefs 
/*! This interface allows for creating, destroying and managing xref records and xref items.
Scene entities such as objects and materials must be xrefed using methods of this
interface. Information related to xref operation and the xref items (IXRefItem) themselves
are stored in xref records (IObjXRefRecord). The object xref manager must also be used 
for modifying and deleting xref items and records, in order to ensure the consistency and 
validity of the remaining xref data.
This interface is implemented by the system (3ds max). To obtain a pointer 
to the object xref manager, call IObjXRefManager8::GetInstace()

Terms used with xrefs:
\li Source file: The file from which scene entities are xrefed
\li Master file: The file into which scene entities of a source file are xrefed
\li XRef item: A master file scene entity that xrefs a specific source file scene entity 
\li Source item: A source file scene entity being xrefed into a master file
\li XRef record: Data structure within the master file that holds xref items and other
data describing an object xref operation or transaction

\see IObjXRefManager, IObjXRefRecord, IXRefItem
\remarks This interface should be used instead of IObjXRefManager.
