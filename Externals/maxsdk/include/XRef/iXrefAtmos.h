//! \brief Class representing xref atmospherics
/*! This interface groups functionality specific to xref atmospherics. In order to
access functionality common to all xref scene entities, use the IXRefItem interface.
An xref atmospheric acts as a wrapper around the xrefed atmospheric (also referred to as
the "source atmospheric"). For example, requests for getting the atmospheric's gizmos 
(NumGizmos, GetGizmo) are passed to the source atmospheric, as are requests for interfaces. 
Client or plugin code working with atmospherics should not be required to write xref 
atmospheric specific code, unless the desired functionality is xref specific.
\note Note that xref atmospherics can only have gizmos that are xrefs (xref objects) themselves.
Xref atmospherics will be automatically removed from the scene when all their
gizmos have been removed.
\note Xref Atmospherics are never nested, even when their gizmos are, and they are 
always owned by non-nested (top-level) xref records.
