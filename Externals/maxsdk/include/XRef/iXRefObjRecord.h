//! \brief Xref record handle type. 
/*! Xref record pointers could be invalidated by operations performed on xref records or xref items,
thus it is not recommended to cache them for later use. Xref record handles overcome this
limitation. They can be cached and used for retrieving xref records in a safe way.
Xref record handles are guaranteed to be unique for all xref records within the current 
scene, but they are not persisted so any handles cached by client code become invalid 
after a new file is loaded.  Client code should not persist these handles.
