//! \brief Generic interface that represents an xrefed scene entity
/*! This interface exposes services common to all xref scene entities.
3rd party plugins do not need to derive from this interface. Support for xrefing 
different plugin categories is provided by the system (3ds Max). Each plugin 
category that supports xrefing is modeled as a class that implements this interface. 

Xref items can be created and modified via the Object XRef Manager (IObjXRefManager8), 
and live in xref records (IObjXRefRecord). An xref item can live in one and only one xref record.

Sub-object animation of a scene entity is maintained when the scene entity is xrefed.
Transform animation of a scene entity such as a node is brought into the master file,
but is not updated when the xref record is updated.

In order to retrieve this interface from a scene entity, one must call either 
IXRefItem::GetInterface with a reference to a scene entity (Object, Atmospherics, etc.), 
\see IObjXRefManager8, IObjXRefRecord
