//! \brief Interface to Asset Tracking System
/*! This interface gives access to the Asset Tracking System. This includes
control over the Asset Tracking dialog, support dialogs, and version control system
integration. It also provides access to the Asset Repathing UI functionality and
file dependency information. The version control system related methods (such as checkin,
checkout, etc.) incorporate the common dialogs used for all providers. For lower level
access to providers use the IATSProvider interface.
