\par Description:
This is the base class for an Extension Channel plug-in. These plug-ins are
used to allow a developer defined object to flow down the geometry pipeline.
This class provides an interface to the extension object. This is the virtual
base class that developers can derive objects from, that should be inserted
into the extension channel of the object flowing up the stack. Extension
Channels will expand the geometry pipeline by allowing one to add a custom
object to the pipeline object that can flow down the pipeline. This object will
get notified whenever something in the pipeline changes. For example, if you
want to indicate when a certain object becomes invalid for export to their game
engine, invalid skin-vertex assignments, bound patches etc. By inserting an
Extension Channel Object (XTCObject, for short) into the pipeline you can
accomplish this, by constantly checking the structure of the object and
displaying wrong faces/vertices etc. in the viewport.\n\n
You can specify which other channels it depends on using <b>DependsOn()</b>.
The extension object has callback methods that get called before and after a
modifier modifies a channel that the extension object depends on using
<b>PreChanChangedNotify()</b> and <b>PostChanChangedNotify()</b>. The extension
object can declare additional channels that it modifies using
<b>ChannelsChanged()</b>, so that it can make any changes to the mesh before
and after the modification by the modifier.\n\n
In general, the Extension Channel is a transient data structure that gets
recreated on every pipeline evaluation. So the object that adds an extension
channel to the modifier stack automatically makes it persistent. However, when
the user collapses the stack, the user might want the Extension Channel to be
preserved as well. In order to accomplish that, please refer to the
Class BaseObject and the methods
<b>NotifyPreCollapse()</b> and <b>NotifyPostCollapse()</b>. These methods will
be called by the collapse code. It will give the modifier or BaseObject, that
adds an XTC object to the stack the possibility to apply a modifier, that
inserts these XTC objects onto the stack after the collapse. Through this
mechanism, the XTC will survive a stack collapse. The Pre and Post
notifications will be called through a pipeline enumeration downstream (for
more info see Class GeomPipelineEnumProc). Developers, who are collapsing the stack
programmatically, have to call this method. In case this method is not called,
the XTC objects will by default be copied as well, since they are part of the
object in the wsCache. However, they won't survive a save/load operation. In
addition to all this, XTC objects also have the possibility to display their
data in the viewports. Any Extension Channel Object can disable the display of
the object itself and take over the entire display itself, by returning true in
the method <b>SuspendObjectDisplay()</b>.\n\n
Note: Modifiers which change the type of object that flows up the stack have to
copy the Extension Channel from the old object into the new one using
<b>CopyAdditionalChannels()</b> (e.g. the extrude modifier has to copy the XTC
from the incoming spline to the Mesh, Patch or NURBS object).\n\n
Note: Compound objects have to merge the Extension Channel of the branched
pipelines into the resulting pipeline. This is in general a simple copy of the
Extension Channel Object into the new Extension Channel. When the
CompoundObject evaluates is branches it would call
<b>CopyAdditionalChannels(os-\>obj)</b>, so that the Extension Channels of the
branches are copied over. In the <b>ConvertToType()</b> method it then has to
copy the Extension Channels from itself to the converted object using
<b>obj-\>CopyAdditionalChannels(this)</b>.\n\n
Also note that the Extension Channel itself is implemented in Class Object.
This means, that it will be available for all pipeline objects that get
implemented in 3ds Max. For additional methods related to extension objects see
the methods in Class Object -\>
<a href="class_object.html#A_GM_obj_extension_chnl">Extension Channel
Access</a>.\n\n
All methods of this class are virtual. Default implementations are shown. <br>
