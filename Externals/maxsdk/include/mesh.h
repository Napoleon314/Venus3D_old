/** \internal A RVertex is a rendered vertex. A vertex becomes a RVertex after
it has been transformed. A RVertex has a position (x, y, z coordinate)
that is stored in device coordinates. They are stored in the data member
Pos[3]. 
One vertex in a Mesh can be shared between many different smoothing
groups. In the 3ds Max Mesh database, the vertices are shared, however
the normals are not. This is why an RVertex has a RNormal data
member. For example, if you had a sphere that had the top and bottom
hemi-spheres smoothed separately (i.e. not smoothed across the equator), then
the vertices across the equator would have two RNormals for each
RVertex while the other vertices would have one. There may be as many
RNormals as there are smoothing groups colliding at a vertex. However,
it is by far the most common case to have one, and anything other than one or
two is very rare. 
For purposes of smoothing, as many RNormals are allocated as required
and are stored in this class. RNormals are kept in this RVertex
class since the RVertex is what gets rendered (lit). When you light a
vertex you need to know its normal direction. Thus the RNormal(s) are
stored in this class (using data member rn or *ern). 
All methods of this class are implemented by the system. 

\note For internal use only. Developers who need to
compute face and vertex normals for a mesh should instead refer to the Advanced
Topics section Computing Face and Vertex Normals.
