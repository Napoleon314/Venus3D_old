\par Description:
This class is the callback object for
<b>ITrackViewNode::RegisterTVNodeNotify()</b>. Developers should derive their
class from this class and implement the <b>NotifyRefChanged()</b> method. This
allows the Track %View Node to intercept reference notifications when they use
a Track %View Node.\n\n
For an example of this class in use by <b>ImageFilter</b> plug-ins see class
<b>UndoNotify</b> in <b>/MAXSDK/INCLUDE/FILTERS.H</b>. It is sub-classed from
this class and provides an implementation of <b>NotifyRefChanged()</b>.\n\n
All methods of this class are virtual.  */
class TVNodeNotify: public MaxHeapOperators {
	public:
		/*! \remarks A plug-in which makes references must implement this
		method to receive and respond to messages broadcast by its dependents.
		\par Parameters:
		<b>const Interval\& changeInt</b>\n\n
		This is the interval of time over which the message is active.
		Currently, all plug-ins will receive <b>FOREVER</b> for this
		interval.\n\n
		<b>RefTargetHandle hTarget</b>\n\n
		This is the handle of the reference target the message was sent by. The
		reference maker uses this handle to know specifically which reference
		target sent the message.\n\n
		<b>PartID\& partID</b>\n\n
		This contains information specific to the message passed in. Some
		messages don't use the <b>partID</b> at all. See the section
		\ref Reference_Messages and \ref partids for more information about the meaning of the
		<b>partID</b> for some common messages.\n\n
		<b>RefMessage message</b>\n\n
		The <b>message</b> parameters passed into this method is the specific
		message which needs to be handled. See \ref Reference_Messages.
		<b>BOOL propagate</b>\n\n
		If called through ReferenceMaker::NotifyDependents(), the value of 'propagate' passed to it.
		Used if calling NotifyDependents() from within NotifyRefChanged()
		\return  The return value from this method is of type <b>RefResult</b>.
		This is usually <b>REF_SUCCEED</b> indicating the message was
		processed. Sometimes, the return value may be <b>REF_STOP</b>. This
		return value is used to stop the message from being propagated to the
		dependents of the item. */

/*! \sa  Class ReferenceTarget, Class Interface, Class Control, Class ImageFilter, Class TVNodeNotify.\n\n
\par Description:
This class provides an interface to Track %View Nodes. A Track %View Node is
simpy a class that has zero or more sub-track view nodes and zero or more
sub-controllers. This is mainly used to provide a place for Global Variable
tracks (labeled "Global Tracks" in Track %View) and Video Post tracks (labelled
"Video Post" in Track %View).\n\n
The TrackViewNode sub-nodes and sub-controllers are identified by a unique ID
in the form of a Class_ID variable. This does not necessarily have to be the
Class_ID of an existing plug-in, however plug-ins may wish to use their
Class_ID for any items they add to be sure they are unique.\n\n
The Interface class provides access to the root track view node:\n\n
<b>virtual ITrackViewNode *GetTrackViewRootNode()=0;</b>\n\n
From the root track view node, new nodes may be added. There are two defined
sub nodes identified by the following <b>\#defined</b> Class_IDs:
\code
#define GLOBAL_VAR_TVNODE_CLASS_ID Class_ID(0xb27e9f2a, 0x73fad370)
#define VIDEO_POST_TVNODE_CLASS_ID Class_ID(0x482b8d30, 0xb72c8511)
\endcode
These can be retreived by calling <b>GetNode()</b> on the track view root node
and passing in one of the above IDs.\n\n
All methods of this class are implemented by the system.\n\n
Note: Developers can also create their own track view node using the following
global function:\n\n
