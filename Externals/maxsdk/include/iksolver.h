\par Description:
This class represents the base class that IK Solver plugins should derive
from.\n\n
The IK solver is a pure mathematical function and does not hold state, but
instead just solves a given, self-contained, mathematical problem, e.g. the
plugin solver does not have influence on when IK is invoked and what an IK
problem is (what is the goal and what are the joints, etc.), but contributes to
IK by providing an answer on how to solve. Structurally, it is independent of
the SDK and, hence, can be built independently, except for some theoretically
independent math library. See the Inverse Kinematics section for more detailed
information.  */

	independent solver does its job based on the state of the goal just at the

	the IK system would have to invalidate joints at time t for the history
	independent solver, and at all times that are greater or equal to t for the
