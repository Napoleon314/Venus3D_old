\par Description:
The abstract graphics window class. The methods here provide low-level access
to 3ds Max's graphics system. These methods are available for plug-ins to do
any graphics work not possible using the standard high-level graphics methods
of 3ds Max.\n\n
These methods are for use in the existing 3ds Max viewports. Note that these
APIs are not for casual use, as they are not intended to be a high level
graphics library. For example, many steps are required to display a single lit
polygon. These APIs are optimized for speed, and not at all for plug-in
programmer ease of use.\n\n
These methods are provided, however, so that developers can do things that are
otherwise impossible using the high-level methods.\n\n
<b>Developers should use these methods with an understanding of exactly what
they are doing since it's quite easy to crash 3ds Max when inappropriate
arguments are supplied. The calls are specifically optimized for exactly the
way 3ds Max uses them. In no way should the calls in GraphicsWindow be
considered an "ordinary" 2D/3D API. (That's what OpenGL, D3D, and HEIDI are
for.)</b>\n\n
One final note of warning: most graphics windows methods execute in a separate
thread (or in multiple separate threads) that are owned by the graphics window.
Thus, due to thread scheduling, when a bad argument or incorrect sequencing of
graphics windows calls causes 3ds Max to crash, it is not at all easy to figure
out where the problem is. In particular, the location of the main 3ds Max
thread is not relevant.\n\n
All the methods of this class are implemented by the system.

	/*! \remarks	This is called to put up the config dialog if the driver supports
	GW_SPT_CAN_CONFIG
	\par Parameters:
	<b>HWND hWnd</b>\n\n
	The parent window handle for the dialog. */
	virtual void	config(HWND hWnd) = 0;
	/*! \remarks Determines if the driver supports the specified feature.
	\par Parameters:
	<b>int what</b>\n\n
	One of the following values:\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_TXT_CORRECT</b>\n\n
	This is used to enable or gray-out the perspective correction right-click
	viewport menu option.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_GEOM_ACCEL</b>\n\n
	This is used to indicate to 3ds Max (and the mesh class in particular) that
	the driver wants to handle all of the 3D data natively. In this case,
	meshes are rendered by passing 3D world space data and letting the driver
	transform, clip, and light the vertices. If this returns FALSE, then the
	mesh class handles all xforms/clip/lighting calculations (using a lazy
	evaluation algorithm) and then calls the hPolygon or hPolyline 2 1/2D calls
	for the driver to rasterize. (Primitives that are actually clipped are
	still sent to the polygon/polyline methods.)\n\n
	Right now, only the OpenGL driver returns TRUE to this query, but other
	drivers have been developed that return TRUE, and the HEIDI and D3D drivers
	may change in the future.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_TRI_STRIPS</b>\n\n
	If this returns TRUE, then 3ds Max will try to stripify meshes before
	calling the rendering methods. Right now, the drivers just return the user
	preference that is set in the driver config dialog. It defaults to
	TRUE.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_DUAL_PLANES</b>\n\n
	If a driver has dual-planes support it returns TRUE. Our OpenGL display
	driver only returns TRUE for this if the underlying display driver has
	implemented a custom OpenGL extension that allows us to handle this
	efficiently.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_SWAP_MODEL</b>\n\n
	This returns TRUE if 3ds Max has to redraw the whole scene any time the
	viewports are exposed.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_INCR_UPDATE</b>\n\n
	This returns TRUE if the driver can update a rectangular subset of the
	viewport without trashing the image outside that rectangle. This is TRUE
	for most drivers that blit the viewport region and FALSE for those that do
	page-flipping in the hardware. For OpenGL, this is TRUE if the display
	driver implements the Microsoft glSwapRectHintWIN extension.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_1_PASS_DECAL</b>\n\n
	This is TRUE if the driver can handle decalling with only one pass. Right
	now, this is TRUE for OpenGL, but FALSE for HEIDI and D3D. (And as with all
	of these options, it may change in a given driver anytime in the
	future.)\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_DRIVER_CONFIG</b>\n\n
	This is TRUE if the driver has a configuration dialog box. This is TRUE for
	all three of our standard drivers.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_TEXTURED_BKG</b>\n\n
	This is TRUE if the viewport background is implemented as a textured
	rectangle, and FALSE if it is a blitted bitmap.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_VIRTUAL_VPTS</b>\n\n
	This is TRUE if the driver allows viewports to be made larger than the
	physical window they are attached to. Right now this is ony TRUE for
	OGL.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_PAINT_DOES_BLIT</b>\n\n
	This is TRUE if WM_PAINT messages result in a blit of the backbuffer (as
	opposed to a page-flipping swap). This allows 3ds Max to do quick damage
	region repair, and works together with the GW_SPT_SWAP_MODEL flag.\n\n
	<b>GW_SPT_WIREFRAME_STRIPS</b>\n\n
	This is TRUE if the driver wants 3ds Max to send down wireframe models
	using triangle strips instead of a bundle of 2-pt segments. This is only
	used by the OGL driver, and it is there as a user-choosable
	performance-accuracy tradeoff (since the strips are faster and are
	back-culled, but they displayhidden edges as though they are visible). */

	that does the actual drawing. When 3ds Max goes to draw objects it will see

	The new methods <b>setHitDistance()</b> and <b>setHitCode()</b> make it
	possible to work with GraphicsWindow hit-testing in otherwise impossible
	situations. Why are they necessary? An example from is shown below. The
	patch object contains bezier spline-based edges which can consist of up to
	102 vertices. Since the GraphicsWindow::polyline function can only plot
	lines with up to 32 vertices, it is impossible to plot these in a single
	call to the polyline function. Multiple calls to the polyline call do not
	return a proper hitcode when using a "window"-type hit region. By using the
	new <b>setHitCode()</b> method, code can properly handle this situation.
	The code below shows the function in use from the PatchMesh::renderEdge method:
	\code	
	int steps = GetMeshSteps();
	int segNum = steps+2;
	float fsegNum = (float) (segNum-1);
	// If steps are too high for GraphicsWindow's buffer, we must draw it
	manually

	Point3 prev,current(.0f,.0f,.0f);
	BOOL hitAll = TRUE;
	BOOL hitAny = FALSE;
	DWORD hitDist = 0xffffffff;
	for(int terp = 0; terp \
	{
	prev = current;
	current = work.InterpCurve3D((float)terp / fsegNum);
	if (terp != 0)
	{
	line[0] = prev;
	line[1] = current;
	gw->clearHitCode();
	gw->polyline(2, line, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL);
	if(gw->checkHitCode()) {
	hitAny = TRUE;
	if(gw->getHitDistance() \
	hitDist = gw->getHitDistance();
	}
	else hitAll = FALSE;
	}
	}
	if(hr && !hr->crossing && hr->type != POINT_RGN)

	fixedBuf[terp] = work.InterpCurve3D((float)terp /
	fsegNum);
	gw->polyline(steps+2, fixedBuf, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL);
	}
	\endcode 
	Note that the <b>gw-\>polyline</b> call is preceded by a call to
	<b>clearHitCode()</b>, and followed by code which checks the hit code,
	maintaining "hitAny" and "hitAll" flags. When all the segments are drawn,
	the <b>gw-\>setHitCode()</b> call is made, setting the hit code depending
	on the hit region type. When the code which called this function checks the
	GraphicsWindow's hit code, it will contain the proper value. This code also
	keeps track of the closest hit distance and places that into the
