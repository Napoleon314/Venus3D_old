/*!  Instructions on how to make a controller lockable. Also please look at the samples in maxsdk\samples\controllers since they
	have been made lockable.

1)  Include the ILockedTracksImp.h header file.
2)  Have your controller derive publically from the default ILockedTrackImp locked track implementation, or if possible from either
the StdControlLocked implementation that includes both StdControl and ILockedTrackImp, or the ControlLocked implementation, that
includes Control and ILockedTRackImp.  These implementations contains all of the logic needed to determine whether or not an item
is really locked, and handles the default mechanism for the unlocking and locking of parent and child subanims.  This requires that
you link with core.lib, which you probably already are.  When possible use either StdControlLocked or ControlLocked since they already
contain default implementations of functions needed to properly lock your controller.  Make sure though that if you override these
default implementations of GetInterface, IsReplaceable, and CanApplyEaseMultCurves that you keep the same logic.
3)  Make sure the void* Animatable::GetInterface(ULONG id) function is defined since it's where the locked track interface resides.
At a minimum you need to implement,
\code
void* GetInterface(ULONG id)
{
	switch (id) {
		case I_LOCKED:
				return (ILockedTrackImp*) this;
		}
	return Control::GetInterface(id);
}
\endcode
4)  If your controller is a leaf controller, you need to disable of appending of ease and mult curves to your controller. To do this you'll
need to modify the CanApplyEaseMultCurves to return false when the controller is locked.  If it's not a leaf controller, there is no need to
worry about this function since you can't apply eases or mult controllers to non-leaf controllers.  Sample Implementation is
BOOL CanApplyEaseMultCurves(){return !GetLocked();}
5)  When a controller is locked it cannot be replaced, so you will need to modify the IsReplaceable() function. A sample implementation is
BOOL IsReplaceable() {return !GetLocked();}  
6) Make sure that the ILoad(ILoad*) and ISave(ISave*) functions are implemented and that you save and load the inherited mLocked parameter
from ILockedTrackImp. Here's a sample implementation,
\code
#define LOCK_CHUNK		0x2535  //the lock value
IOResult MasterPointControlImp::Save(ISave *isave)
{
	Control::Save(isave); // save ORT

	ULONG nb;
	int on = (mLocked==true) ? 1 :0;
	isave->BeginChunk(LOCK_CHUNK);
	isave->Write(&on,sizeof(on),&nb);	
	isave->EndChunk();	

	return IO_OK;
}

IOResult MasterPointControlImp::Load(ILoad *iload)
{
	ULONG nb;
	IOResult res;

	res = Control::Load(iload); // Load ORT
	if (res!=IO_OK)  return res;

	while (IO_OK==(res=iload->OpenChunk()))
	{
		ULONG curID = iload->CurChunkID();
		if (curID==LOCK_CHUNK)
		{
			int on;
			res=iload->Read(&on,sizeof(on),&nb);
			if(on)
				mLocked = true;
			else
				mLocked = false;
		}
		iload->CloseChunk();
		if (res!=IO_OK)  return res;
	};
	return IO_OK;	
}
\endcode
7) When you do a Clone(RemapDir &remap), make sure to clone the value of mLocked and when a Copy(Control *from) occurs make sure copy the
mLocked Value if you do copy that controller. 
8) To reiterate, when you save and load, and clone, and if possible, when you copy, explicitly use the mLocked variable, if possible,
since you are explicitly setting or getting that parameter.  For other functions, if you want to see if you are locked use the
ILockedTrackImp::GetLocked() function since that one will also use any active overrides or container states to determine if you are truly locked. 
9) Inside AssignController(Animatable *control,int subAnim) you need to check both to see if you are locked, in which case you don't
assign the controller, and the controller that's getting assigned over isn't locked also. You may also want to modify CanAssignController
but that function is not used reliably to determine if a controller may get assigned. The key thing needed is to modify AssignController.
10) You need to make sure you lock the functions that bring up UI, which are BeginEditParams and EditTrackParams.  You may need to modify
you EndEditParams function in case it always expects BeginEditParams to allocate certain data.   If you do normally allow the editing of
track params you should have the TrackParamsType function TrackParamsType, return TRACKPARAMS_NONE when the track is locked.
11) In addition to the Animatable functions mentioned above, other Animatable functions that you should lock are those that modify the
keys or other information in your controller, such as CopyKeysFromTime,DeleteKeyAtTime,DeleteKeys, DeleteTime, ReverseTime, ScaleTime,
InsertTime, MapKeys ,AddNewKey, MoveKeys, ScaleKeyValues,CreateLockKey, SetSelKeyCoordsExpr, CommitSetKeyBuffer,  RevertSetKeyBuffer, etc..
12) You should also lock certain schematic view functions that let you change link, such as SvCanConcludeLink,and  SVLinkChild 
13) You usually don't have to lock functions that set selection (SetKeyByIndex, etc..) or flag keys (FlagKey) since in most
circumstances the selection or flag state of a key doesn't change how that controller computes it's value.  In general only lock operations
that will have an effect when ::GetValue is called.
14) The key Control functions that you need to lock include, of course, SetValue, any function that set's a sub-controller, like
SetPositionController, or SetRollController. 
15) Control functions that should never get locked include GetValue of course, ChangeParents since you still want to have parents get
changed possibly.
16) For most controllers, the only IK function that needs to get locked is PasteIKParams. The other functions are needed to be left
unlocked or IK may not work.
17) If the controller inherits from IKeyControl, then some of its functions also need to get locked. They include SetKey and AppendKey.
Note that GetKey returns a pointer to the key so in theory the client may modify it you can't lock it since that's the only way the
client can examine the contents of the key.
18) For PRS controllers, lock the setting of inheritance flags in  SetInherintanceFlags.   Don't lock ChangeParents, since when a parent
changes you will want the keys to modify if needed.  Also you may need to unlock sub controllers, via the
ILockedTracksMan::PushUberUnLockOverride, and I when changing parents before calling SetValue on them. 
19) If you need to unlock something temporarily the best way to do it so the use the ILockedTracksMan::PushUberUnLockOverride
function to set up an override that disables all locks, and then the ILockedTracksMan::PopUberUnLockOverride function to revert the
override unlock state. This is safer than individual unlocking the controller since if a controller is in an imported container, it can't
get unlocked via the other SDK functions.
20) We currently don't lock exposed SDK/MXS functions that may set internal values that are normally locked.  Usually this isn't a problem
since we lock out the default UI.
