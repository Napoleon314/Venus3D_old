	\defgroup Reference_Messages Reference Messages 

This section describes some of the common messages used by references and the
meaning of the \ref partids parameter associated with these messages. Some messages are
sent by the system while others are sent by the plugin. Each method may need to 
pass along additional information so the reference maker may process the message.
This information is passed in the \ref partids parameter. The meaning of the 
information stored in the \ref partids is specific to the message sent along with it.

\note Not all messages use the \ref partids parameter (in fact most don't). In 
these cases the \ref partids will be set to 0. If the plugin is sending the message, it
should set the \ref partids to 0 if not used. In the cases where the \ref partids is used, it
is documented below.\n

Developers who define their own reference messages should do so using a value greater than the following:
\code
#define REFMSG_USER 0x00010000
\endcode
The system uses numbers less than this value.

\sa \ref partid_object_channel

//! \brief The message passed to notify and evaluate.
typedef unsigned int RefMessage;

//! \brief This tests for a cyclic reference. It will return REF_FAIL if there is a loop.
#define REFMSG_LOOPTEST 				0x00000010

//! \brief This message is sent when a ReferenceTarget is deleted. 
/*! In response to this notification, a ReferenceMaker that makes a weak reference 
to the ReferenceTarget or if the target is a node (INode), must set its reference  
storage (data member) to NULL.
Note that the ReferenceMaker must not call ReferenceMaker::DeleteReference() or
ReferenceMaker::ReplaceReference() to set its reference handle to NULL. Also, the
ReferenceMaker must not delete itself in response to this notification. Instead, it 
should return a value of REF_AUTO_DELETE if it is to be deleted.
In the event that multiple references to the ReferenceTarget being deleted are being 
held, the handler for this message must set just the first (in GetReference index 
order) reference handle to the ReferenceTarget to NULL. This message will be sent 
once per reference count, and the calling code performs validations that the message 
was handled properly. The validation assumes that the lowest reference index pointing 
to the ReferenceTarget being deleted is the reference that is cleared. For instance 
if a ReferenceMaker holds multiple references to a particular node in reference slots 
4, 67 and 345, this message will be sent three times. The first call must clear 
reference slot 4, the second reference slot 67, and the third reference slot 345.
Normally you do not need to handle this message if your ReferenceMaker holds only 
strong references to objects other than nodes, as the strong reference should  
prevent the object from being deleted. In the event that the object is deleted
anyhow (typically by an improper hard delete being performed on the object) 3ds Max
will automatically delete all references to that object.

//! \brief A scene entity that owns other scene entities and listens to messages from them.
/*! \sa Class SingleRefMaker, Class IRefTargContainer
	Any scene entity that makes references must be derived from this class. 
	A reference creates a record of the dependency between a ReferenceMaker and a 
	ReferenceTarget. 3ds Max uses a messaging system to notify dependent entities
	about changes. This class has a method that receives the notifications its 
	targets send when they change. It has methods that return the number of 
	references if has, and methods to get and set these references. Also, there 
	are methods for creating, replacing and deleting the references. File 
	input and output is handled via methods of this class (Load() and Save()).
	
	A reference link is similar to the relationship that exists 
	between an observer and its subjects in an observer design patters, except that
	reference links also mean ownership, unless otherwise specified.

	Note that copying ReferenceMaker instances would not correctly establish reference 
	hierarchy relationships between this destination object and the references held 
	by the source object. Therefore copying of ReferenceMakers is prohibited. 
	3ds Max does not control the lifetime of ReferenceMakers but it does that of 
	ReferenceTargets, therefore only cloning of ReferenceTargets is supported.
	For more information, see ReferenceTarget::Clone().

	Note that RefMakerHandle is a typename for pointers to an object of type ReferenceMaker.

	See the section on ~{ Reference System }~
	for an overview of the 3ds Max reference architecture.

		the indexing on the higher-indexed reference target slots may point at an incorrect slot.

			-# Propagates to ALL the items that reference it. 
			-# And also to all the items which reference those items. 
			-# And so on. 
		- The only exceptions to this are as follows:
		-# The propagate parameter passed is FALSE. In that case the message 
			only goes to the immediate dependents.
		-# If the SClass_ID sclass = NOTIFY_ALL parameter limits the dependents
			to a certain specified Super Class.
		-# If one of the items that references the plugin, processes the message
			inside its NotifyRefChanged() and returns REF_STOP instead of 
			REF_SUCCEED. In this case, the message is not further propagated.

		Also, whenever a message propagates, the hTarget parameter received in 
		NotifyRefChanged() is reset to the this pointer of the immediate dependent
		(not the originator) who propagates the message.

	When enumerating indirect references, it is possible to enter an infinite recursive

	processing duplicates by either maintaining a list of all references processed, 
	or by clearing a flag bit on all references and then testing/setting the flag 
	bit as references are processed. In the ReferenceMaker::EnumRefHierarchy method, 
	this object's BeginEnumeration method is called	before starting an enumeration, 
	and EndEnumeration at the end. These methods increment and decrement an internal
	counter. When the counter is decremented to 0, the list of visited references is
	cleared. This ensures that the list of visited references is maintained during 
	recursive calls to EnumRefHierarchy, but cleared when the outer most call is 
	exited. In some cases however, it is desirable to maintain the list of visited 
	references across	calls to EnumRefHierarchy. In these cases, call this object's 
	BeginEnumeration method prior to the calls to EnumRefHierarchy, and

/*! \sa Class RemapDir, ReferenceTarget::Clone()
	Implemented by system. This function should be used by plug-ins to clone a single ReferenceTarget instead of ReferenceTarget::Clone(RemapDir*)
	Calling
	ReferenceTarget::Clone() does not add the old/new ReferenceTargets to the RemapDir passed to Clone, and any backpointers in the reference hierarchy
	under the original ReferenceTarget that points back to that ReferenceTarget will fail to backpatch correctly. This function takes care of
	setting up the RemapDir, calling Clone, adding the old/new ReferenceTargets to the RemapDir, and having the RemapDir perform backpatching.
	So instead of:

	\code
	ReplaceReference(IPBLOCK,ipblock->Clone(DefaultRemapDir()));
	\endcode

	you should say:

	\code
	ReplaceReference(IPBLOCK,CloneRefHierarchy(ipblock));
	\endcode

	If you are cloning multiple ReferenceTargets, you should be creating a RemapDir and cloning the ReferenceTargets
	using RemapDir::CloneRef. Otherwise, any common ReferenceTarget under the ReferenceTargets being cloned would be
	cloned as separate ReferenceTargets, rather than a single ReferenceTarget that is shared. So, for example:

	\code
	RemapDir *remap = NewRemapDir();
	ReplaceReference(ES_MASTER_CONTROL_REF, remap->CloneRef(from.masterCont));
	ReplaceReference(ES_SLAVE_CONTROL_REF, remap->CloneRef(from.slaveCont));
	remap->Backpatch();
	remap->DeleteThis();

/*! \sa Class ReferenceMaker, Class IRefTargContainer
	This class encapsulates the management of one single reference.
	It is entirely implemented by 3ds Max. Plugins can use SingleRefMaker as is,
	or derive from it when they need to respond to reference 
	messages other than REFMSG_TARGET_DELETED.
	A SingleRefMaker can optionally automatically drop its reference on shutdown. If a SingleRefMaker
	holds a reference to a ReferenceTarget whose class is implemented in a plugin dll, dropping the
	reference after the dll is unloaded may cause access violations if the ReferenceTarget is deleted.
	If a SingleRefMaker can exist into the shutdown phase, and the SingleRefMaker may hold a reference
	to a plugin object, the reference must be dropped before the plugin dlls are unloaded. Either the owner
	of the SingleRefMaker should do this, or the SingleRefMaker should be set to automatically do this.
	Normally, dropping the reference on a NOTIFY_SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN is the correct option. But if the owner
	of the SingleRefMaker needs the reference to held longer, the reference can be safely held up to the
	NOTIFY_PLUGINS_PRE_UNLOAD notification.
