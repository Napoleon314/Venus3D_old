/*!
 * \brief Helper class used to implement destructive copy semantics and allow
 * for AutoPtrs to be used as return values.
 *
 * You don't really need to know this since the compiler will use 
 * AutoPtrRefs silently and everything will just work out the way you'd 
 * expect, but here's an explanation of why AutoPtrRef is needed.
 *
 * Values returned by functions are temporaries (unnamed objects that you 
 * never actually see in your source code).  These then get copied into 
 * whatever variable is set up to receive them. (See More Effective C++, 
 * items 19 and 20.)
 *
 * Since these temporaries are inaccessible to normal source code, it is
 * usually a design error for them to be modified, so the compiler makes
 * them const.  They can't be bound to non-const references, which are
 * needed for the AutoPtr copy constructor and assignment operator.
 * Attempting to return and receive an AutoPtr from a function would then
 * generate a compiler error.
 * 
 * The AutoPtrRef and cast operations below exist to allow the compiler 
 * to implicitly convert from the const AutoPtr returned from a function 
 * to an AutoPtrRef, which can then be assigned to the receiving AutoPtr 
 * using the AutoPtr(AutoPtrRef&) constructor.
 *
 * (Okay, there's a bit more going on to get around the double-conversion
 * rule, which Herb Sutter explains as: "[A] subtle interaction in the
 * overload resolution rules allows the selection of single viable
 * constructor function, followed by the manufacture of just the right
 * temporary which lets us slip in a second user-defined conversion (to
 * auto_ptr_ref<Z>) that is normally forbidden by 12.3/4." From
 * the thread "What is auto_ptr_ref for?" on comp.lang.c++.moderated.)

/*!
 * \brief Automatic memory-ownership pointer supporting "resource acquisition
 * is initialization."
 *
 * This is a standardized implementation of std::auto_ptr from the STL, allowing
 * us to portably include AutoPtrs in the 3ds Max SDK without forcing a compiler
 * or runtime dll version on third-party developers.  std::auto_ptrs are 
 * described in your favourite STL documentation, in Scott Meyers's More 
 * Effective C++ and on pp. 367-368 in Bjarne Stroustrup's The C++ Programming 
 * Language.  This implementation is based on Stroustrup and Meyers.
 *
 * AutoPtrs grant the same mechanics as a regular pointer, so they can be
 * created, assigned and dereferenced much in the same way as a plain old 
 * pointer.  Additionally, AutoPtrs provide "resource acquisition is 
 * initialization" and automatic memory ownership management in two ways:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The object pointed to by the AutoPtr will be implicitly deleted when 
 * the AutoPtr goes out of scope</li>
 * <li>Through "destructive copying" that causes a copied AutoPtr to surrender 
 * ownership to the pointed to object.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * This is a very useful technique for making the ownership semantics of a 
 * function very clear.  A function that takes an AutoPtr to an object as a 
 * parameter is stating that it assumes ownership of the pointed to object and
 * that the caller must surrender ownership.  A function that returns an
 * AutoPtr states that the caller must assume ownership of the pointed-to 
 * object.
 *
 * AutoPtrs help prevent memory leaks and lead to exception safe code by 
 * guaranteeing that dynamically allocated objects will be deleted when the
 * AutoPtr goes out of scope.  The following is unsafe code:
 * \code
 * void foo()
 * {
 *    A *a = new A();
 *    // ...
 *    delete a;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Will leak if any exception is thrown in the "..." part.  Replacing with
 * an AutoPtr guarantees that the memory is cleaned up, since leaving the
 * function through an exception will cause the AutoPtr to go out of scope.
 * \code
 * void foo()
 * {
 *    AutoPtr a(new A());
 *    // ...
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Since not all objects have the same destruction requirements, the AutoPtr 
 * template can be parameterized to support creating various types 
 * of AutoPtrs differentiated by their DestructorPolicy. Three standard forms,
 * the default AutoPtr&lt;Type&gt;, ArrayAutoPtr&lt;Type&gt;, and 
 * DeleteThisAutoPtr&lt;Type&gt are available.  AutoPtr's default destructor 
 * policy is for use with a pointer pointing to a single object (one that uses 
 * new and delete).  ArrayAutoPtr is for use with a pointer pointing to an 
 * array (one that uses new [] and delete []).  DeleteThisAutoPtr is for use
 * with Max types requiring clean up through a DeleteThis method.
 *
 * The two standard implementations are probably enough to cover most cases.
 * Other derivations would be used for, say, pointers using malloc and free or
 * to hide the destructor implementation details by using an explicitly typed, 
 * non-templated DestructorPolicy to avoid having to inline the Delete method.
 * This is necessary to implement explicit template instantiation for a forward
 * declared type.  The standard templates can't be explicitly instantiated on a 
 * forward declared type since they require that the destructor be defined.
 *
 * NB: The destructive copy semantics mean that AutoPtrs are 
 * inappropriate for use in any of the STL's container classes. 
 * Classes with data members of type AutoPtr must be non-copyable (derive from 
 * class MaxSDK::Util::Noncopyable), or implement their own copy constructor and 
 * assignment operator where they deep-copy the object being owned by the AutoPtr. 
 *
 * NB2: Finally, be careful about passing AutoPtrs across DLL boundaries for
 * DLLs compiled with different compilers or different memory allocation 
 * schemes.  Objects traversing such boundaries must be deallocated on the same 
 * side as they were allocated.  One way to guarantee this is to use it with objects
 * derived from MaxHeapOperators, or to override a class's delete operator so
 * that the code that actually frees the memory is on the correct side of the DLL boundary.
