//! Container Interface
//!
//! \brief IContainer provides access to the container object functionality. 
/*! 
A container is a helper object in the scene.  Once created, the user can choose its content, 
that is, nodes that are meant to be grouped together.  Containers should be self-contained blocks
without references from the content to nodes outside of the container, otherwise the references 
will be lost during operation of the container.  Containers hold the content, and  moving or 
deleting a container will affect the content, but containers and content are not the same thing.  
For example, content can be unloaded, while the container remains in the scene.  The container 
is associated to a container definition file, which is a Max file that stores only the container and 
its contents.  Container definitions are tracked as file assets.

There are two types of containers:

-#	Local Containers:  Containers can be created locally and used to organize scenes in ways that 
are similar to the uses of groups or layers.  This provides a way to collect a bunch of nodes and work 
with them as one, or to section part of your scene to share with others.  If a local container  
has no content that is inherited from any source (including nested containers, that is, containers 
inside containers), we can call it a unique container.  If content is inherited at all, it is  
not a Unique container.

-#	Inherited Containers:  Containers can also be inherited.  When you inherit a container from 
someone else, you get its contents.  If the author allows, you can open the container and add  
changes, while still inheriting the author's changes.  This allows teams to work collaboratively.

Content nodes of containers are all children of the container.  It is possible to have objects linked 
to containers or contents of containers without being inside, but this is not recommended.  It is not   
possible to instance containers, but they can be copied, and then changes to one of the copies can be 
saved, and all containers can be reloaded, and all copies will inherit the changes.  Many containers 
can point to the same definition.

In addition to the content, containers also govern what users of a container are allowed to do 
with the content if they inherit the container.  This is called the container rules.  At the moment, 
the only options are either no access (the user can only read in the content but make no modification)
or edit in-place, which allows someone inheriting the container to modify the content and save the
result, overwriting the original definition.

Containers can be closed, making the content uneditable.  When a container is closed the content behaves 
like an xreffed scene, displayed and rendered but not selectable or editable.

//!
//! \brief IContainerObject13 extends container object functionality.
//! In particular it provides support for new access rules that inherited containers may follow.
/*! 
Previously, containers would only allow for no access when inherited or access to edit in place so that
a user can save over the original definition.  Now in addition a container can grant access to only add new objects
over the inherited container or get full freedom to access anything that was unlocked on the original source definition.
For the latter case the user can specify additional locks over certain items, such as all materials, all modifiers, all
transforms or all objects, to restrict what's accessible further.
