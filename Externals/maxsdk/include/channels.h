Some of the sample code specifies these channels as PART_* as opposed to *_CHANNEL.
For example, PART_GEOM|PART_TOPO instead of GEOM_CHANNEL|TOPO_CHANNEL. 
The proper usage is the *_CHANNEL version.

to the Sub-Object drop down in the 3ds Max user interface. This channel indicates 
which level the object is at. This is also specific to the object type. There are

is at object level selection. */
