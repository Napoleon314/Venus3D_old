/*! \brief An application/plugin specific custom data that can be attached to animatables.
Instances of this class store custom data defined by plugins and are attached to
animatables when plugins call Animatable::AddAppDataChunk. Plugins don't need to
instantiate directly objects of type AppDataChunk, but can get to the instances
stored on animatables by calling Animatable::GetAppDataChunk.

\par Example
This example is from samples/utilities/appdata.cpp:

		/*! The data members are initialized to the values passed. 
		\param cid - The Class_ID of the owner of the custom data.
		\param sid - The SuperClassID of the owner of the custom data.
		\param sbid - An extra ID that lets the owner identify its sub-custom-data (chunks).
		\param len - The length of the data in bytes.
		\param data - Pointer to the actual data. The data should be allocated 
		on the heap by client code using MAX_malloc(). This will allow the system to 
		free it safely (using MAX_free()). MAX_malloc() and MAX_free() are memory 
		management routines implemented by the system. 
		\note Important: Not allocating on the heap the data passed to this method may 
		lead to unexpected behavior of the application. 
		\note Important: Client code does not need to	free the data that has been passed 
		to this method. The system will free it when the Animatable is deleted or when
		client code explicitly removes the custom data chunk from the Animatable by
		calling Animatable::RemoveAppDataChunk.		*/
