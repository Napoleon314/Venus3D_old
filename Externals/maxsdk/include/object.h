	The object then iterates through its points calling their deformer's

	\par The following is an issue that developers of world space modifiers need to
	be aware of if the world space modifier specifies anything but generic
	deformable objects as its input type. In other words, if a world space
	modifier, in its implementation of Modifier::InputType(), doesn't
	specifically return defObjectClassID then the following issue
	regarding the 3ds Max pipeline needs to be considered. Developers of other
	plug-ins that don't meet this condition don't need to be concerned with
	this issue.
	\par World space modifiers that work on anything other than generic deformable
	objects are responsible for transforming the points of the object they
	modify into world space using the ObjectState TM. To understand why this is
	necessary, consider how 3ds Max applies the node transformation to the
	object flowing down the pipeline.
	\par In the geometry pipeline architecture, the node in the scene has its
	transformation applied to the object in the pipeline at the transition
	between the last object space modifier and the first world space modifier.
	The node transformation is what places the object in the scene -- thus this
	is what puts the object in world space. The system does this by
	transforming the points of the object in the pipeline by the node
	transformation. This is only possible however for deformable objects.
	Deformable objects are those that support the
	Object::IsDeformable(), NumPoints(), GetPoint() and
	SetPoint() methods. These deformable objects can be deformed by the
	system using these methods, and thus the system can modify the points to
	put them in world space itself.
	\par If a world space modifier does not specify that it works on deformable
	objects, the system is unable to transform the points of the object into
	world space. What it does instead is apply the transformation to the
	ObjectState TM. In this case, a world space modifier is responsible for
	transforming the points of the object into world space itself, and then
	setting the ObjectState TM to the identity. There is an example of this in
	the sample code for the Bomb space warp. The Bomb operates on
	TriObjects and implements InputType() as { return
	Class_ID(TRIOBJ_CLASS_ID,0); }. Since it doesn't specifically return
	defObjectClassID, it is thus responsible for transforming the points
	of the object into world space itself. It does this in its implementation
	of ModifyObject() as follows: 
	\code
	if (os->GetTM())
	{
		Matrix3 tm = *(os->GetTM());
		for (int i=0; i<triOb->mesh.getNumVerts(); i++) {
			triOb->mesh.verts[i] = triOb->mesh.verts[i] *tm;
		}
		os->obj->UpdateValidity(GEOM_CHAN_NUM,os->tmValid());
		os->SetTM(NULL,FOREVER);
	}
	\endcode
	As the code above shows, the Bomb checks if the ObjectState TM is non-NULL.
	If it is, the points of the object are still not in world space and thus
	must be transformed. It does this by looping through the points of the
	TriObject and multiplying each point by the ObjectState TM. When it
	is done, it sets the ObjectState TM to NULL to indicate the points are now
	in world space. This ensure that any later WSMs will not transform the
	points with this matrix again.
	\par For the Bomb world space modifier this is not a problem since it specifies
	in its implementation of ChannelsChanged() that it will operate on
	the geometry channel (GEOM_CHANNEL). Certain world space modifiers may
	not normally specify GEOM_CHANNEL in their implementation of
	ChannelsChanged(). Consider the camera mapping world space modifier.
	Its function is to apply mapping coordinates to the object it is applied
	to. Thus it would normally only specify TEXMAP_CHANNEL for
	ChannelsChanged(). However, since it operates directly on
	TriObjects, just like the Bomb, the system cannot transform the
	points into world space, and therefore the camera mapping modifier must do
	so in its implementation of ModifyObject(). But since it is actually
	altering the points of the object by putting them into world space it
	is altering the geometry channel. Therefore, it should really
	specify GEOM_CHANNEL | TEXMAP_CHANNEL in its implementation of
	ChannelsChanged(). If it didn't do this, but went ahead and modified
	the points of the object anyway, it would be transforming not copies of the
	points, but the original points stored back in an earlier cache or even the
	base object.
	\par This is the issue developers need to be aware of. To state this in simple
	terms then: Any world space modifier that needs to put the points of the
	object into world space (since it doesn't implement InputType() as
	defObjectClassID) needs to specify GEOM_CHANNEL in its
	implementation of ChannelsChanged().

	// Retrieve the TriObject from the node

	TriObject *triObject = GetTriObjectFromNode(ip->GetSelNode(0),deleteIt);

	// Note that the TriObject should only be deleted

/** This is a callback class that can be given to a ObjLightDesc to have a
ray traced through the light volume. A plug-in derives a class from this one
and passes it as a callback in the ObjLightDesc method
TraverseVolume(). This allows a developer to integrate the illumination
of a segment due to a light. t0 and t1 define the segment in
terms of the given ray. 
This is what the 3ds Max spotlights do: First they break the segment up into
three main pieces. The first piece is from the camera to where the ray
intersects the lights cone volume. The callback Step() is called once
over this segment (t0 and t1 will have this first piece). The
illumination is constant over this entire segment from t0 to t1.
It is a constant black since the light is not illuminating it at all. 
The next segment is inside the cone. This segment will be broken up into small
pieces. First as it's stepping along it will be between the falloff and the
hotspot. The illumination over this segment goes from black to brighter and
brighter as it moves towards to hotspot. Across the entire hotspot region the
illumination may be constant. Then as it steps from the hotspot to the falloff
the illumination will go back down to black. 
Inside the hotspot region, if shadows are turned on, the light may be brighter
or darker depending on if it's inside a shadow or on the edge of a shadow. The
light handles all of this. It takes care of the shadows, attenuation, etc. 
Now consider how the 3ds Max atmospheric effects such as the volume lights use
this information. For each light that they are bound to, they call the method
TraverseVolume() on the light. The volume light atmospheric effect
passes this callback to the TraverseVolume() method. The light then
calls this Step() method of the callback for each partial segment of the
ray. Given the illumination on the segment (illum) it computes the fog
density over that piece. The density may be constant if noise is not turned on,
or it may vary if noise is turned on. Using the fog density and the
illumination it computes the light reflected off the atmosphere for the
segment.

	\par Consider how the 3ds Max atmospheric effects like the volume lights use
	this information. For each light the atmospheric effect is bound to, it
	calls the this method (TraverseVolume()) on the light. The volume
	light atmospheric effect passes a callback to this method (proc).

	computes the fog density over that segment. The density may be constant if
	noise is not turned on, or it may change if noise is turned on. Using the
	fog density and the illumination it computes the light reflected off the
	atmosphere for the segment.
	\param sc This is the ShadeContext passed into the Shade() method of
	the Atmospheric effect. The shade context passed in should only be used for
	state (like are shadows globally disabled). The position, normal, etc.
	serve no purpose.
	\param ray Defines the world space ray that will be traversed.
	\param samples The number of samples to sample along the ray. A reasonable range is from
	25-100. This is more or less the suggested number of times the
	proc-\>Step() callback will be called. It is not precisely however
	because the system may take greater or fewer steps than specified as it
	needs to.
	\param tStop This is the end of the ray. This is the point at which the traversal
	will stop (ray.p+tStop*ray.dir). Note that the traversal can
	terminate earlier if the callback returns FALSE.
	\param attenStart Specifies a percent of the light attenuation distances that should be used
	for lighting during the traversal. This is used so a light can have an
	attenuation set to a certain percent, and then have the volume light be
	attenuated at a different point.
	\param attenEnd This specifies the ending percent of the light attenuation distances that
	should be used for lighting during the traversal.
	\param flags There are three ways the shadow maps can be sampled. If none of these flags
	are set, the shadow map is sampled directly (this is the fastest). One of
	the following values: 
	TRAVERSE_LOWFILTSHADOWS\n
	This is a simple filtering where the system samples a point in the shadow
	map and then some of the neighboring points. This corresponds to 'Medium'
	in the Volume Light user interface (a value of 0 for flags is 'Low' -- just
	sampling the shadow map with no filtering at all). 
	TRAVERSE_HIFILTSHADOWS\n
	This is a higher resolution sampling. This corresponds to 'High' in the
	Volume Light user interface. 
	TRAVERSE_USESAMPLESIZE\n
	This produces the highest quality. This corresponds to 'Use Light Sample
	Range' in the Volume Light user interface. This is like a box filter, but
	also takes into consideration the position of the point within the pixel to
	do additional weighting.\n

	/** This method checks a particles position and velocity to determine if there

	was a collision, the particles position and velocity should be
	modified. 
	The plug-in may compute a line segment between where the particle is now,
	and where it will be in dt amount of time. The plug-in then checks
	if the line segment intersects the collision object. If so, it would
	compute the resulting position, and modify the velocity vector vel
	to point in the new direction (presumably reflected across the surface
	normal). 
	3ds Max 3.0 introduced interparticle collision (where particles may collide
	with other particles). In order to implement interparticle collision (IPC)
	in the presence of collision objects, it became necessary to generalize the
	operation of the deflectors so that they didn't always work in discrete
	time intervals. 
	That is, in the general case of an unidentified number of particles
	interacting in an unspecified way, it was necessary to allow everything
	involved in that system to update to specified times without moving
	past that time. 
	In the absence of IPC enabled, the particle system calls the bound
	collision objects with the parameter UpdatePastCollide == TRUE, and
	the deflector checks all collisions, updates particles based on their
	collisions with deflectors and the ensuing, remaining time intervals in
	dt subsequent to the collisions. 
	In the presence of IPC that won't work. When IPC is active, all particles
	need to be updated to the time of the first collision in the system in
	dt, whether that collision be between particles or between particles
	and deflectors. Thus, in the presence of IPC, all particle updates to bound
	deflectors are called with UpdatePastCollide == FALSE. In that case,
	the collision objects return both the position and velocity of the updated
	particles and the time at which the collision occurred. 
	All such times are compared, along with all possible internally calculated
	IPC event times. If there are any nonnegative times returned greater than
	or equal to zero, all particle states are reverted to their states at the
	beginning of the interval and then updated to the precise minimum time
	returned as the earliest collision. And then everything starts up
	again trying to update itself to the next integral time, when control can
	pass back to whatever is asking the particles to update themselves. If
	there are other collisions in that time, it happens again. 
	This whole set of operations happens after any true returns from the
	trilinear sort/sweep correlator that looks for the possibility of
	collisions. If there are no possible collisions, everything proceeds
	through a complete interval normally.
	\param t The time to check for collision.

/** ShapeObjects are open or closed hierarchical shapes made up of one or more
pieces. This base class defines a set of methods that plug-in shapes must
implement. 
Note: Many plug-in shapes may be derived from
Class SimpleSpline rather than this
class and have fewer methods to implement. See that class for more details. 
Any classes subclassing
off of ShapeObject should be sure to call the ShapeObject constructor in their
constructor, in order to properly initialize the fields contained in the
ShapeObject. This is the thickness field, which specifies the
thickness of the mesh generated from the shape at rendering time. For
example:
\code
LinearShape::LinearShape() : ShapeObject()
{
	...
}
\endcode
Also, the ShapeObject contains Load and Save methods, which handle the
storage of the data contained within the ShapeObject. In order to properly
store this information, classes which subclass off of ShapeObject need to call
the ShapeObject Load and Save methods before storing their information. For
example: 
\code
IOResult LinearShape::Save(ISave *isave)
{
	IOResult res = ShapeObject::Save(isave);
	if(res != IO_OK)
		return res;
	...
}

IOResult LinearShape::Load(ILoad *iload)
{
	IOResult res = ShapeObject::Load(iload);
	if(res != IO_OK)
		return res;
	...
}
\endcode
The number of ShapeObject references/subanims are defined as
SHAPE_OBJ_NUM_REFS and SHAPE_OBJ_NUM_SUBS in /include/object.h
and are set to the number of references and subanims in the ShapeObject class,
you can use them to make your code more bullet-proof should the number of

	/** This method is called when an item in the modifier stack before this
	modifier sends a \ref REFMSG_CHANGE message via
	NotifyDependents(). 
	Consider the following example: Assume the modifier stack contains a Sphere
	Object, then a Bend, then a Edit Mesh. The Edit Mesh modifier does not have
	a reference to the Bend or the Sphere because it does not officially depend
	on these items. However it does depend on them in a certain sense, because
	it modifies the data that these items produce. So, if they change it may
	affect the modifier. A modifier may build a cache based on its input
	object. The modifier needs a way to know when to discard this cache because
	the input object has changed. Whenever one of the items before this
	modifier in the stack sends out a \ref REFMSG_CHANGE message via
	NotifyDependents() to indicate it has changed this method is called.
	The modifier may respond in a way appropriate to it, for example by
	discarding its cache of the input object. 
	It is not legal, to issue a NotifyDependent()'s in the
	NotifyInputChanged() method of a modifier, without checking for
	reentrancy. Imagine, you have an instanced modifier applied to the same
	object in the stack. Sending a refmsg from the NotifyInputChanged
	method will casue an endles loop. Simply putting a guard in, that checks
	for reentrancy should get rid of the problem.

	\param partID This is the partID from the message.

	\param mc The ModContext for the pipeline that changed. If a modifier is applied to
	multiple objects, then there are ModApps in each pipeline that it is
	applied to. These ModApps are pointing to the same modifier. Consider the
	following example: Say you apply a Bend modifier to a Sphere, a Cylinder
	and a Box object. There are three ModApps but only one Bend modifier. Then
	you go to the Sphere and adjust its Radius. This will cause
	NotifyInputChanged() to be called on the Bend because the Bend's
	input changed. However only one of its inputs changed - only the Sphere
	changed and not the Cylinder or the Box. Therefore
	NotifyInputChanged() will be called once, and the ModContext passed
	in will be for the Sphere's changed pipeline. It is possible that all three
	objects could change at the same time. If an instanced float controller was
	assigned to the radius, width, and height - one parameter for each object -
	then the controller was adjusted in the function curve editor, all three
	items would change. In this case NotifyInputChanged() would be
	called three times on the Bend. Once for each pipeline, once with each
	ModContext. */

support conversion of a native 3ds Max type (such as TriObject) to a plug-in's
