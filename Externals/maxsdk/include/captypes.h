/*! The capping code does the best job it can given this constraint, however it 
is possible to wind up with long sliver-like faces on the cap. This is referred
to as a morph cap because if you cap a shape using this method, it does not
generate any new vertices and you can then morph between shapes with the same
number of vertices. */
#define CAPTYPE_MORPH 0		//!< Uses the existing vertices in the PolyShape to generate the cap.
/*! This helps to break up the shape and helps reduce slivering. Grid capping
will generate a different number of vertices based on the shape and thus the
shapes are not morphable. */

// Capping information classes:
// These classes provide information on how a cap is put together, based on the following:
//
// For Mesh caps, you get a list of created triangular faces, where the vertex indices are
// either original vertices on the PolyShape, newly created vertices inside the shape, or
// newly created vertices on the edge of a shape.  New vertices are only created for GRID
// type capping.  Cap info is always stored in unflipped form -- That is, faces are oriented
// in a counterclockwise order as viewed from the shape's "front", or positive Z.
//
// New free vertices are listed in the MeshCapInfo's "newVerts" table, a simple Point3 table.
// The "newVert" member of the MeshCapVert class points to the entry in the newVerts table.
//
// New edge vertices are stored with the polygon and segment number where they reside, along
// with a position on that segment (0-1) where they reside.  This information allows the cap
// user to divide adjacent faces as needed.
//
// For Patch caps, you can only cap using MORPH type capping.  GRID capping is meant for Mesh
// caps, where distorting a non-subdivided cap would result in serious surface discontinuities.
// Patches are automatically subdivided, so GRID capping is unnecessary there.
