\par Description:
This is the base class for the creation of sound plug-ins. The 3ds Max user may
choose a sound plug-in using the File / Preferences... Animation Tab / Sound
Plug-In option.\n\n
There is always one sound object in the scene. A sound object's primary purpose
is to provide a sound track for the scene. The sound object also serves as a
clock that controls timing when an animation is played. This ensure the
animation is synched to the sound object. This class has methods to start and
stop the sound playing, play a specified range of the sound, and toggle the
sound on and off.\n\n
A sound plug-in can participate in Track %View by implementing the methods of
Animatable such as <b>PaintTrack()</b>. See the Advanced Topics section
~{ Track View }~ for
details.\n\n
Sound Object plug-ins use a Super Class ID of <b>SOUNDOBJ_CLASS_ID</b>.  */

		<b>TimeValue tStart</b>\n\n
