class IContainerUpdateReplacedNode;
/*! This class provides an interface for classes that may need to augment the new container update process that was introduced in 3ds Max 2011.
During this update process, locked items from the source are merged into the master file and replace their
corresponding locked counterpart in the master if one exists. This process is automatic but sometimes the item in question needs to augment 
this process since some information may get lost during this merge and copy process.  Note there may be some other cases where the source item 
is merged in, for example unlocked modifiers may get copied in from the source if that modifier doesn't exist in the master.
An example of a class that needs to implement this is the skin modifier. When a skin modifier is put onto the modifier stack on some node,
any existing weight information on the specific vertices are automatically lost, since they are stored in the local mod data for modifier instance,
even though that skin modifier has the correct nodes in its node list, which is the case during the container update process. 
So what the skin modifier needs to do is provide an implementation of ILockedContainerUpdate interface. In the ILockedContainerUpdate::PreReplacement
function it copies and saves out it's weight information, and then in the ILockedContainerUpdate::PostReplacement function it pastes these
weights back onto itself, since this function is called after the replacement has happened. You can see this example at maxsdk\\samples\\bondesdef.

Note that the container update process does handle the transferring of node references during the process, that's why the skin modifier
doesn't need to worry about having the correct nodes it's node list. However external non-node references aren't automatically handled so
an item has one and this reference isn't locked, it will need to make sure that the correct one is found and the reference replaced. For example
we do this internally with our wire parameters, if the object that's controlling the wire isn't locked we make sure that this existing master
item replaces the merged item that's coming in from the source.

/*! \brief This class provides an interface to retrieve what new node will replace an existing one during the local edit process.
An instance of this class is passed in the function ILockedContainerUpdate::PreReplacement and ILockedContainerUpdate::PostReplacement. \see ILockedContainerUpdate
Here's a possible example of a fake class that maintains the distance between two nodes that needs to recalculate this distance during the container update 
process.
/code
class ReplacedNodeExample : public ILockedContainerUpdate
{
...
	INode *mNode1; //one node
	INode *mNode2; //another node
	float mDistanceBetween; //distance between them that's calculated once the nodes get set.
}
void ReplacedNodeExample::PreReplacement(INode *sourceNode, Animatable *sourceAnim, INode *masterNode, Animatable *masterAnim, IContainerUpdateReplacedNode *man,
										 MSTR &log)
{
	INode *newNode1 = man->NewNode(mNode1);
	//if mNode1 is a reference no need to do mNode1 = newNode1 or SetReference(newNode1)...
	INode *newNode2 = man->NewNode(mNode2);
	//calculate new distance between.
	if(newNode1 && newNode2) //they may have gotten deleted
		mDistanceBetween = Distance(newNode1.GetTrans() - newNode2.GetTrans());
