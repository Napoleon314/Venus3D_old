/*! The size is 32 bits per pixel. This is the channel that would be used by a depth of 
field blur routine for instance. The Z value is at the center of the fragment that is
foremost in the sorted list of a-buffer fragments. The Z buffer is an array of float values
giving the Z-coordinate in camera space of the point where a ray from the camera through
the pixel center first intersects a surface. All Z values are negative, with more negative
numbers representing points that are farther from the camera. The Z buffer is initialized
with the value -1.0E30. \n\n
Note that for non-camera viewports (such as Front, User, Grid, Shape, etc.) the values may
be both positive and negative. In such cases the developer could add a large value onto all
the values to make them all positive. This is because positive versus negative doesn't
really mean anything. It is just the distance between values that matters. \n\n
As noted above, the Z values in the A buffer are in camera space. The projection for a
point in camera space to a point in screen space is:
\code
Point2 RenderInfo::MapCamToScreen(Point3 p) {
  return (projType==ProjPerspective)?
  Point2(xc + kx*p.x/p.z, yc + ky*p.y/p.z):
  Point2(xc + kx*p.x, yc + ky*p.y);
}
\endcode
This function is supplied by the RenderInfo data structure which can be obtained from the bitmap output by the renderer using the function Bitmap::GetRenderInfo(). Note that this outputs a Point2. There is no projection for Z. As noted before, the Z buffer just uses the camera space Z.

class GBuffer : public InterfaceServer\n\n
\par Description:
This class is used by Bitmaps to implement an enhanced G-Buffer (providing more
functionality than the 2.x G-Buffer). The new G-Buffer stores multiple layers
at each pixel. The Virtual Frame Buffer includes a new spinner to the right of
the "channels" drop down which lets you look at the different layers. (It only
appears when there are G-Buffer channels present).\n\n
The multiple layers of the G-Buffer allow rendering effects to do better
antialiasing and handling of transparency. The frontmost layer is still stored
in the G-Buffer as full, screen-sized arrays, one for each channel. The
subsequent layers are stored in a variable number of "layer records" all of
which are the same size (which depends on which channels have been requested
via the <b>GBuffer::CreateChannels()</b> function). Even scenes with no
transparency can have more than one layer at a given pixel. This can occur
along the edges of an object, where the object partially covers some pixels,
and another object (or objects) is visible in the remaining part of the pixel.
Each visible face in the pixel will be represented by a fragment. A given
object will not always appear on the same layer. If it is the only object in a
pixel it will be in the frontmost layer, but where it is partially occluded it
will lie in a layer behind the occluding object.\n\n
Another way multiple layers can occur (aside from transparency) is when objects
are given the "Render Occluded Objects" property in the object properties
dialog. When an object has this property, it acts as if it were transparent,
and objects behind it, though invisible, are rendered and stored in the
G-Buffer.\n\n
Another G-Buffer layer is added to contain the background color in its color
channel for any pixel which is not empty and on which the background gets
evaluated. This means the background layer will be present behind transparent
objects or objects with "render occluded" turned on. It will also be present
along the edges of objects where the background is partially visible in the
pixel. Note: This does not depend at all on having the <b>GB_BG</b> flag set.
It is necessary to have the <b>GB_COLOR</b> channel, however.\n\n
All methods of this class are implemented by the System.\n\n
<b>Note on RPF files</b>: The following information relates to the layer
storage scheme used in the 3ds Max RPF files.\n\n
The layer information for each scan line is stored as a series of run-encoded
channels, each containing the same number of data elements, one per layer
record. The first channel is a "psuedo-channel" that contains the x value for
each layer record. If there are multiple layers for a given x, this will be
reflected as several identical x values in a row.\n\n
For instance, if the x channel contained\n\n
5,6,7,7,8,8,8,9,10\n\n
And the Z channel contained\n\n
100, 100, 100,200, 100,200,300, 100, 100\n\n
This would mean at pixel 7 there are 2 layers, and pixel 8 there are 3
layers.\n\n
Pixel depths\n\n
5 100\n\n
6 100\n\n
7 100, 200\n\n
8 100, 200, 300\n\n
9 100\n\n
10 100   \n\n
As an extra note regarding RPF files, a new data member was added to
class RenderInfo, which is saved with the
RPF (and RLA) files. In order to avoid getting out of sync with previous file
format implementations a "version" word preceding the RenderInfo record has
been added into the format. The version is set to a value that will distinguish
it from the first word of the RenderInfo data, enabling it to determine the
version. If we make further additions to RenderInfo in the future, the version
will allow us to keep it straight. To load both older and newer RPF and RLA
files correctly, the code that loads the RenderInfo been modified, and
therefore any plugins and 3rd party code that read these files need to be
changed. Here's the code:\n\n
\code
  #define RENDINFO_VERS1 1000   
  int RLAReader::ReadRendInfo(RenderInfo *ri) {   
	  short vers;   
	  if (fread(\&vers,sizeof(short),1,fd)!=1) return 0;   
	  int size = sizeof(RenderInfo);   
	  if (vers != RENDINFO_VERS1) {   
		  // the old version didn't start with a version word, but   
		  // with projType which is 0 or 1.   
		  size -= sizeof(Rect); // The old record didn't have the region Rect.   
		  fseek(fd,-sizeof(short),SEEK_CUR); // Undo the version read   
	  }   
	  if (ri) {   
		if (fread(ri,size,1,fd)!=1) return 0;   
	  }   
	  else   
		fseek(fd, size, SEEK_CUR);   
	  return 1;   
  }  
  \endcode
