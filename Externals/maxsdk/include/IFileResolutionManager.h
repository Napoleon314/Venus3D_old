/* \brief Finds the physical location of an asset file
	
	The File Resolution Manager(FRM) returns an absolute file path as soon as it finds the physical location of the asset file.
	This file path is converted to an absolute UNC path	if the user preference "Resolve Path to UNC" 
	is turned on. See the IPathConfigMgr::SetResolveUNC(bool aFlag)

	If the asset filename is an absolute path:
	- the FRM first checks the absolute path for the asset file
	- then, if a scenefile is currently open, it checks whether the file is in the same 
	  directory as the current scenefile 
	- then it checks the User Paths directories associated with the asset's AssetType
	- then, if a scenefile is currently open, it checks all the subdirectories of the folder that 
	  contains this current scenefile
	- then it gives up

	If the asset filename is a relative path:
	- the FRM roots the relative path to the 3dsmax project folder and checks whether the file is there
	- then, if a scenefile is currently open, the FRM roots the relative path to the folder that
	  holds this current scenefile, then checks if the file exists there
	- then, if a scenefile is currently open, the FRM checks if the asset filename (without the relative
	  path) exists in the folder that holds this current scenefile
	- then, the FRM roots the relative path to the User Paths directories associated with the asset's AssetType
	  and checks whether the file exists there
	- then, if a scenefile is currently open, the FRM checks for the asset filename (without relative path) in
	  all the subdirectories of the folder that contains this current scenefile.
	- then it gives up
