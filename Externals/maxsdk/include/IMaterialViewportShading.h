//! A new interface for 3ds Max 2008
/*! This interface is used for manipulating material shading model in the viewport. A material
would implement this interface so as to control the "Show map in viewport" (SMIV) button.  In 3dsmax 2008
the SMIV button can now show as a flyoff, for regular shading (Blue) and Hardware shading (Pink).  If 
a material supports a Hardware representation then it can implement this interface and return the correct
level support in IsShadingModelSupported.  This will mean the UI is reflective of the support available.
This interface DOES NOT provide any support for the actual Hardware implementation - purely the UI synchronisation.  
An implementation for this interface can be found at \\maxsdk\\samples\\materials\\StdMaterialViewportShading.cpp where
it support the case where the material deals with plugin hardware shaders as well.
Currently in 3ds max 2008, only two materials implement a Hardware version, and they are the Standard Material and 
Mental Images's Architectural and Design Material.
