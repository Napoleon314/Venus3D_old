This class represents a patch vector. This can be either an interior vector or
an edge vector. All methods of this class are implemented by the system.
\par Data Members:
<b>Point3 p;</b>\n\n
The vertex location.\n\n
<b>int vert;</b>\n\n
The vertex which owns this vector.\n\n
<b>IntTab patches;</b>\n\n
These are the patches that share this vector. If the edge is open there will
only be one patch. In this case <b>patches[0]</b> will be used and
<b>patches[1]</b> will be -1. Note: As of R4.0 the previous array of [2] has
been replaced with the IntTab because vectors can now be used by more than two
patches.\n\n
<b>DWORD flags;</b>\n\n
The patch vector flag:\n\n
<b>PVEC_INTERIOR</b>\n\n
This indicates the vector is an interior vector. These are the three vectors
inside a tri patch or the four inside a quad patch.\n\n

\par Description:
This class stores the information associated with a patch vertex and provides
methods to access the data associated with this vertex. All methods of this
class are implemented by the system.
\par Data Members:
<b>Point3 p;</b>\n\n
The vertex location.\n\n
<b>IntTab vectors;</b>\n\n
The list of vectors attached to this vertex. There can be any number of vectors
attached to a vertex. For example consider the north pole of a sphere made from
a set of triangular patches. If there were 16 patches meeting at this point
there would be 16 vectors. The table contains the indices of these vectors.
This is set up automatically when a developer calls <b>buildLinkages()</b>.\n\n
Note: <b>typedef Tab\<int\> IntTab;</b>\n\n
Note that the methods below allow a developer to manipulate the tables of this
class. Developers must be careful when doing so as it is easy to corrupt the
patch data structures. It may be easier for developers to manipulate the
patches, delete vertices, etc., by manipulating them in the <b>PatchMesh</b>
and then call <b>buildLinkages()</b> again. The methods below do work however
and may be used.\n\n
<b>IntTab patches;</b>\n\n
The list of patches using this vertex.\n\n
<b>IntTab edges;</b>\n\n
This data member is available in release 4.0 and later only.\n\n
The list of edges using this vertex. This table will be set up automatically
when a developer calls <b>buildLinkages()</b>.\n\n
<b>DWORD flags;</b>\n\n
The patch vertex flags\n\n
<b>PVERT_COPLANAR</b>\n\n
This constrains things such that this vertex and all the vectors that are
attached to it are coplanar. If this is set, and you call
<b>ApplyConstraints()</b>, the system will adjust the vectors to the average
plane that they are in and then constrain them to it.\n\n
<b>PVERT_CORNER</b>\n\n
The vertex is a corner.\n\n
<b>PVERT_HIDDEN</b>\n\n
The vertex is hidden.\n\n
<b>int aux1;</b>\n\n
Used to track topo changes during editing (Edit Patch).\n\n
<b>int aux2;</b>\n\n
Used to track topology changes during editing (PatchMesh).  */

/*! \sa  Class PatchMesh, Class TVPatch, ~{ Patches and Faces }~.\n\n
\par Description:
A <b>PatchMesh</b> is made up of a series of <b>Patch</b> objects derived from
this class. This is similar to the way faces relate to a mesh. All methods of
this class are implemented by the system.
\par Data Members:
<b>int type;</b>\n\n
The patch type. One of the following values:\n\n
<b>PATCH_UNDEF</b>\n\n
Undefined.\n\n
<b>PATCH_TRI</b>\n\n
Triangular patch.\n\n
<b>PATCH_QUAD</b>\n\n
Quadrilateral patch.\n\n
<b>int v[4];</b>\n\n
A patch can have three or four vertices based on the <b>type</b>. The corner
vertices on a patch are referred to as <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, (and if
it's a quad patch <b>d</b>). These are ordered <b>a, b, c, d</b> going
counter-clockwise around the patch.\n\n
<b>int vec[8];</b>\n\n
A patch can have six or eight vector points. The vectors are referred to as
follows: <b>ab</b> is the vector coming out of vertex <b>a</b> towards
<b>b</b>. <b>ba</b> is the one coming out of <b>b</b> towards <b>a</b>.
<b>bc</b> is the vector coming out of <b>b</b> towards <b>c</b>. <b>cb</b> is
the one coming out of <b>c</b> towards <b>b</b>, and so on.\n\n
<b>int interior[4];</b>\n\n
A patch can have three or four interior vertices.\n\n
<b>Point3 aux[9];</b>\n\n
This is used internally for triangular patches only (degree 4 control
points).\n\n
<b>int edge[4];</b>\n\n
Pointers into the edge list. There can be three or four depending on the patch
<b>type</b>.\n\n
<b>DWORD smGroup;</b>\n\n
The smoothing group. This defaults to 1. All patches are smoothed in a
<b>PatchMesh</b>.\n\n
<b>DWORD flags;</b>\n\n
\section patchDisplayFlags Patch Flags
The following value may be set.\n\n
<b>PATCH_AUTO</b>\n\n
Interior vertices are computed automatically if this flag is set (and normally
it is set). An example of when this flag would not be set is if you were
creating a primitive using patches that needed to make special interior control
points to create the shape. In this case you'd clear this flag and then put
whatever values you needed into the <b>vec</b> array.\n\n
<b>PATCH_HIDDEN</b>\n\n
The patch is hidden.\n\n
<b>PATCH_LINEARMAPPING</b>\n\n
This option is available in release 4.0 and later only.\n\n
The patch is using the old linear mapping scheme.\n\n
<b>PATCH_USE_CRUVED_MAPPING_ON_VERTEX_COLOR</b>\n\n
This option is available in release 4.0 and later only.\n\n
The patch is using the new curved mapping for vertex colors also.\n\n
<b>int aux1;</b>\n\n
This data member is available in release 3.0 and later only.\n\n
This is used to track topology changes during editing (Edit Patch).\n\n
<b>int aux2;</b>\n\n
This data member is available in release 3.0 and later only.\n\n
This is used to track topology changes during editing (PatchMesh).  */

		// TH 6/12/00 -- Added AutoSmooth method for Smooth modifier
		/*! \remarks This method is available in release 4.0 and later
		only.\n\n
		This method will perform automatic smoothing on the patch mesh. The
		smoothing angle is determined for each patch by computing the normals
		at each corner of the patch (using the corner vertex and the two edge
		vectors connected to that vertex), then averaging the normals of the
		two corners of each edge to arrive at a normal for that edge. These
		normals are used to determine whether adjacent patches are within the
		auto-smooth threshold angle.
		\par Parameters:
		<b>float angle</b>\n\n
		The minimum angle between surface normals for smoothing to be applied,
		in radians.\n\n
		<b>BOOL useSel</b>\n\n
		If this parameter is set to TRUE then only the selected patches are
		smoothed.\n\n
		<b>BOOL preventIndirectSmoothing</b>\n\n
		TRUE to turn on; FALSE to leave it off. This matches the option in the
		Smooth Modifier UI -- use this to prevent smoothing 'leaks" when using
		this method. If you use this method, and portions of the patch mesh
		that should not be smoothed become smoothed, then try this option to
		see if it will correct the problem. Note that the problem it corrects
		is rare, and that checking this slows the automatic smoothing process.
