		in some applications. It is not suitable for use as a pipeline object. All
		methods of this class are implemented by the system.

		MNMesh has a winged-edge structure and a highly interlinked topology. This is

	//@{
	/** Creates a new vertex in the middle of an edge, splitting the
	edge into two edges. Unlike SplitEdge, this routine requires a triangle
	face on each side. Since it has this, it also creates new edges connecting
	the new vertex with the point opposite the split edge on each face. This in
	turn splits the faces. So two triangles sharing this single edge become
	four triangles with four shared edges meeting at a single new vertex.\n\n
	This method requires that MN_MESH_FILLED_IN be set (otherwise it will cause
	an assertion failure), and maintains the combinatorics completely.
	\par Parameters:
	int ee\n\n
	The edge to split. Note that if the faces on either side do not have deg=3
	and hdeg=0, an assertion failure will result.\n\n
	float prop\n\n
	The proportion along the edge for the new vertex to be located. This ranges
	from 0, at v1, to 1, at v2. A value of .3, for instance, would create a new
	vertex at .7*P(v1) + .3*P(v2).\n\n
	float thresh\n\n
	If prop is less than thresh or more than 1-thresh, the method will not
	split the edge, and will return v1 or v2 respectively. This is so that
	calling routines can safely pass values anywhere from 0 to 1, without
	worrying about creating tiny "shard" faces.\n\n
	bool neVis\n\n
	This tells whether the new edges that split the faces should be visible.
	(The new edge formed from part of the old edge takes such characteristics
	from the old edge.)\n\n
	bool neSel\n\n
	This tells whether the new edges that split the faces should be selected.
	(The new edge formed from part of the old edge takes such characteristics
	from the old edge.)
	\return  The index of the new vertex created, or the index of the old
	vertex you can use instead if you're within thresh of the endpoints. */

	The barycentric coordinates of the new point you wish to add. If this is

	float thresh\n\n
	If one of the barycentric coordinates is greater than 1-thresh, that vertex
	dominates completely. No splitting is done, and that vertex is returned. If
	not, but if one of the barycentric coordinates is less than thresh, the new
	point must fall on the opposite edge. SplitTriEdge is therefore called on
	that edge, and passes along the value this returns.\n\n
	bool neVis\n\n
	Whether or not the new edges connecting the new vertex to the corners
	should be visible.\n\n
	bool neSel\n\n
	Whether or not the new edges connecting the new vertex to the corners
	should be selected.

	The subdivision technique is as follows: a new point is added at the

	three new edge points to the opposite original vertex passes through the

	This technique for tessellation is based on a paper, "A Subdivision Algorithm
	for Smoothing Down Irregularly Shaped Polygons", published by D. W. H. Doo of
	Brunel University, Middlesex, England, in IEEE in 1978. It essentially creates
	a new face for every vertex, face, and edge of the original mesh. The new
	vertices this technique requires are made by creating one vertex for each
	corner of each original face. These vertices are located on a line from the
	original face corner to its center. All the faces around a given (targeted)
	vertex will create such a point; these points form the corners of the face
	created from this vertex. The original faces become smaller, as they use the
	new points instead of their old corners. And the four new points created on the
	faces on either side of an edge, for the endpoints of that edge, become the
	four corners of the new face representing the edge. Apply a MeshSmooth with
	default values to a 3ds Max box to see how this plays out.
	\par Parameters:
	float interp\n\n
	The position along the line from a vertex to the center of each face to create
	the new vertex at. If this value is near 0, the original faces will shrink very
	little, and the new faces at the vertices and edges will be very small. If this

	This technique for tessellation is based loosely on a 1998 SIGGraph paper,

	and VertexWeights methods of MNMesh. Like other subdivision routines, this

/** Used for caching face and edge clusters, vertex normals, and other
		derived data about an MNMesh. There is a SetMesh() method to set
		the current mesh that the TempData is based on, then there's a series of
		methods to update the cache and return some sort of derived data. All of these
		methods follow the form:

		\code
		DerivedData *MNTempData::DData(parameters);
		\endcode

		DerivedData is the container for the derived data requested (often a simple
		table, though there are some specialized classes returned from some methods).
		If the data has already been computed, the parameters are ignored and the
		cached data is returned. Otherwise, the data is computed from the parameters
		and the current mesh.

		There are no procedures in place to detect changes in parameters or the mesh
		since the last time a method was called, so it's the calling routine's
		responsibility to free invalid structures. If you know that only certain
		pipeline channels, such as GEOM_CHANNEL have changed, you can use the
		Invalidate(ChannelMask channels) method. (GEOM_CHANNEL would free
		the distances-to-selected-vertices, for example, but not the Edge
		Clusters.)

		In particular, there is no way for the MNTempData to know when its mesh
		pointer is no longer valid, so it's vital that the calling routine clear the
		mesh (with SetMesh(NULL)) or stop using the MNTempData when this
		happens.

		All data members are private. They basically consist of a series of pointers
		which are initialized to NULL and then filled with allocated derived data as
		requested. There is also a NULL-initialized, private mesh pointer which is set
		with SetMesh(). Editable Poly uses this class to hold all the varieties
		of temporary, cached data it creates -- examples are vertex normals and face
		clusters.

		To use MNTempData, just set it to your mesh and start querying the member functions.

		MyAlgorithm (MNMesh *m) {
				MNTempData mtd(m);
				// Get Edge Clusters.
				MNEdgeClusters *eclust = mtd.EdgeClusters ();

/** When a Mesh object or modifier (such as Editable Mesh, Edit Mesh, or Mesh
		Select) handles viewport subobject selection, the flow is basically as follows
		from Editable Mesh.    
		- EditTriObject::HitTest is called with window information.\n\n
		- It passes the hit region description to Mesh::SubObjectHitTest\n\n
		- Mesh::SubObjectHitTest culls some subobjects (say, because they're
		backfacing), and creates hits for others that are within the hit region.\n\n
		- EditTriObject::SelectSubComponent is called with the list of hits, and\n\n
		constructs the appropriate BitArray selection.\n\n
		The problem was that in cases of Window selection, you want to only select an
		element or polygon if all the faces of that element or polygon were in the
		selection region. But since some of these faces could have been culled, they
		might not have hit records even if they're within the correct region. This
		would mean, for instance, that a window selection of an entire Sphere would
		fail to get select its single element, because all the backfaces would not\n\n
		have been selected.\n\n
		So in order to do this correctly, we need the face culling information. This
		information is stored and applied in the new MeshSelectionConverter interface,
		which is part of class Mesh.\n\n
		This sort of culling and subobject level translation is not only relevant for
		Polygon and Element selections, but also for "By Vertex" selections of edges,
		faces, polygons, or elements.\n\n
		Examples of the use of this interface are available in
		maxsdk/SAMPLES/mesh/editablemesh/triobjed.cpp, and in meshsel.cpp and
		editmesh.cpp in maxsdk/SAMPLES/modifiers..\n\n
		Owner: class Mesh\n\n
		InterfaceID: MESHSELECTCONVERT_INTERFACE\n\n

		\par Flags:
		We have the usual three methods for setting, clearing, and getting flags: void
		SetFlag (DWORD f, bool value=true) void ClearFlag(DWORD f) bool GetFlag (DWORD f)\n
		We currently only have one flag influencing subobject selection conversion:
		MESH_SELCONV_REQUIRE_ALL\n
		If set, it implies that, for instance, an element is only selected if all of
		its (non-culled) faces are selected. If cleared, an element is selected if any
		of its faces are selected.
