//! \brief The function-published interface for managing SimpleFaceData channels on an object.
/*! This manager allows simple per-face data channels to be added, removed and retrieved from
the specified editable mesh or poly object. This static function-published interface is 
registered as a core interface. Obtain a pointer to this interface with GetInterface() using 
its defined ID, SimpleFaceDataManger_InterfaceID. Functions provided by this interface can 
also be called through function-publish dispatching and through Maxscript.

	entire modifier stack.

	editable poly objects are currently supported.
	\param[in] type - A ParamType or ParamType2 enum value that specifies the data type for all
	faces within the data channel. The current list of supported types is:
	- TYPE_INT
	- TYPE_INDEX
	- TYPE_BOOL
	- TYPE_FLOAT
	- TYPE_POINT2_BV
	- TYPE_POINT3_BV
	No channel is added if an unsupported type is specified.
	\param[in] pChannelID - The identifying Class_ID of the new channel. Specify NULL to have a
	unique ID generated and assigned to the new channel. If an ID is specified, no channel is 
	added if a channel with the specified ID already exists.
	\param[in] pChannelName - The name of the new channel. Specify NULL to use a default channel name.
	\return A pointer to the new channel instance if one was added. NULL if	no channel was added.
