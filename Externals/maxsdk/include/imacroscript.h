 *		imacroscript.h - Public interface to Macro script manager for the MAX CUI
 *
 *	Macro scripts (or macros) are scripts that live in buttons and menus in the new 
 *  customizable UI.  The macro script manager keeps a directory of all known macros 
 *  and provides an API for running and editing macros and for accessing and 
 *  updating the directory.
 *
 *  The directory is used by the CUI to provide a list of available macros in the 
 *  toolbar/menu/shelf editor.  The API also provides a way for the CUI
 *  to open a macro editor to allow on-the-fly creation of macro scripts. 
 *
 *  Macros are normally entered into the directory by the MAXScript compiler as a
 *  side-effect of compiling a macro () definition.  Anyone using MAXScript can at
 *  any time eval a macro definition and thereby add CUI macro scripts.
 *  Consequently, macros can be stored in any script file and be loaded just by
 *  executing the file.  The macro definition syntax permits any number of macros per
 *  file.  
 *
 *  Most macros will be stored in files in a special CUI macro or config
 *  directory so that a user can take all his custom UI stuff with him by copying
 *  directories.  (this directory supports recursive scanning of sub-dirs,
 *  so users can organize their macros)
 *  On-the-fly macro creation in the CUI editor or by text drag-and-
 *  drop onto the shelf or by evaling a definition in the listener will generate 
 *  a file in this directory to provide permanent storage.

/*! This class provides access to a single macro entry. There are methods provided
to access the macro ID, name, category, file name, tooltip, UI button text, and
the UI button icon. MacroEntries are returned from methods of class MacroDir.
Macro scripts (or macros) are scripts that live in buttons and menus in the new
customizable UI. The macro script manager keeps a directory of all known macros
and provides an API for running and editing macros and for accessing and
updating the directory.
All macro scripts have a name and a category. The category is used to organize
the macros into groupings and is given to the macro script at definition time.
If you look at the macro scripts list in the UI Customize dialog, you see a
Category dropdown with things like 'Cameras', 'DragandDrop', 'LightTools',
etc., which is derived from the all categories present in the currently-defined
macroscripts. Note that the normal way to define a macroScript is through
MAXScript, the .mcr files in the UI/MacroScripts directory contain examples,
and they all have category definitions.
Note: In order to use these methods you need to link to <b>"MAXSCRPT.LIB"</b>.

\par Description:
This class provides access to Macro scripts. Macro scripts (or macros) are
scripts that live in buttons and menus in the customizable UI. Methods of this
class are availalble to access macros using IDs or category and name strings,
methods to edit macro scripts, methods to execute macros, and methods for
directory scanning and loading.\n\n
The directory instance (access via the global function
<b>GetMacroScriptDir()</b>) is used by the CUI to provide a list of available
macros in the toolbar/menu editor. The API also provides a way for the CUI to
open a macro editor to allow on-the-fly creation of macro scripts.\n\n
The macro script manager keeps a directory of all known macros and provides an
API for running and editing macros and for accessing and updating the
directory.\n\n
Macros are normally entered into the directory by the MAXScript compiler as a
side-effect of compiling a macro definition. Anyone using MAXScript can at any
time eval a macro definition and thereby add CUI macro scripts.\n\n
Consequently, macros can be stored in any script file and be loaded just by
executing the file. The macro definition syntax permits any number of macros
per file.\n\n
Most macros will be stored in files in a special CUI macro or config directory
so that a user can take all his custom UI stuff with him by copying
directories. (This directory supports recursive scanning of sub-dirs, so users
can organize their macros). On-the-fly macro creation in the CUI editor or by
text drag-and-drop onto the shelf or by evaling a definition in the listener
will generate a file in this directory to provide permanent storage.\n\n
