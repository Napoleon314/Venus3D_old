//! \brief An interface used to translate custom lights to mental ray.
/*!
	This interface makes it possible for 3rd party light plugins to specify their
	own shaders and properties for use with mental ray. This interface is basically
	used to fill up the miLight structure (see the mental ray documentation for
	details on the miLight structure). Any miLight parameter which is not supported
	by this interface is queried on class LightObject instead. The shadow options,
	for example, are retrieved through the shadow generator plugin assigned to the light.

		- For point lights with non-constant intensity (e.g. spotlights with falloff), 
		the flux is an integration of the intensity (in candelas) over the sphere.
