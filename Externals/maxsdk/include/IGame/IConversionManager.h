//!A User definable Coordinate System
/*! The developer can use this to define the Coordinate System that they are using.  Rotation specifies whether
it is a Right or Left handed system.  The Axis define which way the primary axis point.  This will mean that the 
data extracted is converted correctly, and the winding order is correct for Left and Right handed systems.
\n
In 3ds Max this could be defined as
\n
<pre>
UserCoord = {
1,	//Right Handed
1,	//X axis goes right
4,	//Y Axis goes in
2,	//Z Axis goes up.
1,	//U Tex axis is left
0,  //V Tex axis is Up
}
</pre>

for DirectX and OpenGL are provided.  This means that all Matrix and vertex data will have been converted ready to use
on your target system.
