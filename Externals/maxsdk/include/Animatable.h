This is the base class for all animatable scene entity types, and for most plugin types. 
Methods are available for getting the ClassID and SuperClassID of the plug-in, deleting
this instance of the plug-in class, and parameter editing in the command panel.
There are also methods that deal with the sub-animatables of the plug-in. Most
of the track view related methods are here as well.

<b>AnimPropertyList aprops;</b>\n\n
This is a table of properties that a plug-in may use for its own storage needs.
This table is also used by the system (for example Note Tracks and APP_DATA). A
plug-in may use this, for example, when a class has some data that is used
while its user interface is up. It can store the UI data on the property list
temporarily and not have to carry around the data when it is not needed. See
the methods of Template Class Tab for how to
add and delete items from the list. Also see the methods <b>GetProperty()</b>
and <b>SetProperty()</b> and Class AnimPropertyList. 
Note that it's not safe to copy Animatable objects because the properties
held in AnimPropertyList do not have a well-defined copy semantics */

		// OLE-like method for adding new interfaces
		/*! \remarks This method provides a mechanism for extending the class in the future.
		In 3ds Max 4.0 there are new interfaces that are accessed by passing an
		id to this method and it will respond by returning the corresponding
		interface pointer.\n\n
		This method has been used however for a different purpose. It currently
		is used to determine if an object is of a particular class. With
		controllers for example, there is one base class Control, however there
		are many super classes (<b>CTRL_FLOAT_CLASS_ID</b>,
		<b>CTRL_SCALE_CLASS_ID</b>, etc.). If you wanted to find out if a given
		Animatable was a controller you would need to compare its SuperClassID
		to all the known types and only if it wasn't one of the known types
		could you be sure it wasn't a controller. Having to do this is
		inconvenient for a developer.\n\n
		Instead the Control class implements this method. It looks at the id,
		and if it matches a predefined constant <b>I_CONTROL</b>, it returns
		its <b>this</b> pointer. In this way, given any Animatable, it is easy
		to find out if it is a controller by simply asking for the control
		interface. There is a macro that does this:\n\n
		\code
		#define GetControlInterface(anim)
		((Control*)anim-\>GetInterface(I_CONTROL))
		\endcode
		A plug-in developer may use this macro as follows:\n\n
		<b>Control *c = GetControlInterface(anim);</b>\n\n
		This will either be NULL or a pointer to a valid controller.\n\n
		Note: Plug-in defined interfaces should be greater than the following
		value:\n\n
		<b>\#define I_USERINTERFACE 0x0000ffff</b>\n\n
		If a plug-in implements this method for its own purposes, it would, in
		general, switch on the id and if it is not aware of the id it would
		call this method on the base class. Otherwise it could respond to the
		id as it needed. See the sample code below for the how the Control
		class implements this method.
		\param id The id of the interface.
		\par Default Implementation:
		<b>{ return NULL; }</b>
		\par Sample Code:
		The following is the Control class implementation of this method. It
		looks at the <b>id</b> passed, and if it matches <b>I_CONTROL</b> it
		returns its <b>this</b> pointer. Otherwise it calls the base class
		method.\n\n
		\code
		void* Control::GetInterface(ULONG id)
		{
		    if (id==I_CONTROL) {
		        return this;
		    }

		Note for 3ds Max version 1.1:\n\n
		Two new property IDs have been added:\n\n
		<b>PROPID_CLEARCACHES</b>: When passed to a texture map or material,
		the material should dump any of its caches. For example, the bitmap
		texture responds to this by freeing the bitmap from memory. For sample
		code see <b>/MAXSDK/SAMPLES/MATERIALS/BMTEX.CPP</b>.\n\n
		<b>PROPID_HAS_WSM</b>: When passed to an INode, will return TRUE if the
		node has World Space Modifiers applied to it or FALSE if it does not.
		For sample code see <b>/MAXSDK/SAMPLES/IMPEXP/3DSEXP.CPP</b>.\n\n
		Note for 3ds Max version 1.2:\n\n
		A new <b>id</b> has been created and assigned the constant:\n\n
		<b>\#define PROPID_EVAL_STEPSIZE_BUG_FIXED 0x1000</b>.\n\n
		This only effects the evaluation of objects when rendering them using
		motion blur. Motion blur works by evaluating the object numerous times
		(at fractions of a frame apart) and combining these images by blending
		them together.\n\n
		Originally, 3ds Max would make these evaluations in reverse order
		within a sub-frame -- from the last one, to the second to the last one,
		back to the first one. There is a problem with this for certain
		plug-ins that need to compute their state from time 0 forward. For
		these objects, the backwards approach may be too computationally
		intensive.\n\n
		Both the forward and backward approaches exist in 3ds Max and the
		developer may choose which method to use. 3ds Max interrogates the
		object to see how it should handle the evaluation process -- either
		going backwards or forwards. It calls this method with <b>id</b> set to
		the constant <b>PROPID_EVAL_STEPSIZE_BUG_FIXED</b>. If a plug-in
		implements this method to return nonzero, it means the plug-in works
		correctly using forward stepping, and 3ds Max will use that approach.
		If a plug-in does not implement this method and handle the <b>id</b> of
		<b>PROPID_EVAL_STEPSIZE_BUG_FIXED</b> it will return the default value
		of zero. This means the older method of backwards evaluation will be
		used.\n\n
		Therefore, a plug-in object that wants to handle motion blur using
		forward stepping should implement this method, and if passed an
		<b>id</b> of <b>PROPID_EVAL_STEPSIZE_BUG_FIXED</b>, should return
		nonzero.
