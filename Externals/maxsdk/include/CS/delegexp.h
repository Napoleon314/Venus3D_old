//! \brief An interface class to the delegate.
/*! The class provides functions to directly query specific delegate information. 
It is mainly intended to be used by a crowd behavior plugin.
This class can be returned by calling the method GetInterface() from a Delegate node. For Example:
\code
 Sample Code, starting with an INode(node)

     Object *o = node->GetObjectRef();
     if ((o->ClassID() == DELEG_CLASS_ID)
     {

         // Get the Delegate Export Interface from the node 
         IDelegate *Iface = (IDelegate *) o->GetInterface(I_DELEGINTERFACE);

         // Get the delegate's average speed at time t
         float AverageSpeed = Iface->GetAverageSpeed(t);
     }
		
	// Release the interface. NOTE that this function is currently inactive under MAX.
	//o->ReleaseInterface(I_DELEGINTERFACE,Iface);
