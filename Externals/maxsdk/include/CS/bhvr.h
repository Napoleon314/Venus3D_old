//! \name Performance Functions
//! These functions are called for each delegate assigned to a behavior, 
//! each frame during a simulation. Depending on the value returned from the BehaviorType function,
//! only one of the following three functions must be implemented.
//@{
		//! \brief This is the main function for FORCE behaviors.
		/*! It is called every frame for each delegate the behavior is acting upon.  
			It is within this function that the behavior may set any combination of the following:
			the force acting upon the delegate, the delegate's speed, or a goal towards 
			which the delegate should move.
			\param[in] node - the delegate
			\param[in] t - the current simulation time
			\param[in] numsubsamples - how many subsamples are being computed per frame. Currently not used.
			\param[in] DisplayHelpers - whether or not the behavior should display it's visual
			information.  This parameter exists so that the Crowd system has global control over when the 
			behavior information is displayed.
			\param[in] BhvrWeight - A float value, greater than or equal to 0.0, that corresponds
			to the BehaviorWeight value in the Crowd Assignment dialog.  This value should
			be used to scale the returned force value in the out parameter.
			\param[out] out - A PerformOut structure that is used to pass out information that the behavior calculates.  
			The structure has 4 items that may be set, depending upon whether the behavior sets a force, 
			a speed or a goal.  
			\li frc: If the behavior sets a force, the frc value should be filled 
			with a vector normalized to the average speed of the delegate it is acting upon. 
			Usually this normalized vector will be scaled also by the BhvrWeight parameter.
			\li goal: If the behavior sets a goal, then the goal item should be set with the world space
			goal that the delegate is trying to reach.  It is important to note that in order for the 
			behavior to work with Biped crowds, it needs to set a goal.  Even if the behavior doesn't 
			appear to have a clear-cut goal, a goal may still be set for it by placing the goal along 
			the force vector at some reasonable distance.  The delegate's average speed works well.
			\li speedwt: If the behavior sets a speed, then the speedwt should be set
			to the behavior's desired speed for the delegate at the current simulation time.  
			The speedwt will be multipled by the delegate's average speed. (so a value of 1.0 is equal 
			to the delegate's average speed). 
			\li speedAtGoalwt: The speedAtGoalWt is only used by delegates associated with bipeds.  
			If the speedAtGoalWt equals 1.0, the biped will attempt to maintain its current speed.  
			If it is 0.0, the biped will attempt to stop.  If it is < 0, the biped will try to slow down.  
			If it is > 1, the biped will try to speed up. \n
			Note that the behavior doesn't need to be setting a goal in order to set the
			speedAtGoalwt.  This is how the SpeedVary function works.  The instantaneous speed is
			the speed at the current time, while the speedAtGoalwt is the speed that it wants to
			reach at some time in the future.
			\return 0 if the behavior isn't active for this particular delegate, or if the behavior, 
			for any reason, wishes to have no effect on the delegate at this time.  Otherwise, it 
			returns the union of three \#defines, BHVR_SETS_FORCE, BHVR_SETS_GOAL, and BHVR_SETS_SPEED, 
			depending upon whether or not the behavior sets a force, a goal or the speed.   For example, 
			a behavior that sets both a force and goal will return BHVR_SETS_FORCE | BHVR_SETS_GOAL.  
			Which of these values are returned determines which items in the PeformOut structure are valid.

		//! \brief This is the main function for CONSTRAINT behaviors.  
		/*!	It is called multiple times per frame for each delegate the behavior is acting upon.  
			It is within this function that the behavior may set a modified velocity or 
			modified position for a delegate.
			\param[in] node - the delegate
			\param[in] t - the current simulation time
			\param[in] numsubsamples - how many subsamples are being computed per frame. Currently not used.
			\param[in] DesGoalExists - whether or not a goal currently exists for this delegate.  
			If it exists, it will be passed in via the inOut parameter.
			\param[in] DisplayHelpers - whether or not the behavior should display it's visual
			information.  This parameter exists so that the Crowd system has global control over 
			when the behavior information is displayed.
			\param[in] finalSet - whether or not this is the final time that the constraint
			will be called during the frame.  Currently, each constraint behavior is called two
			times per frame (this may change in the future) - once after all of the forces have 
			been assembled and just before a possible avoid behavior, and then once again at the
			end of the frame.  It is called multiple times per frame so that the behavior may
			work correctly with any active avoid behavior.  This flag lets the behavior know if
			it is the last time it will be called during that frame and thus should cache any
			information that it needs for the next frame calculation.  Usually if the behavior
			isn't doing any sort of per frame caching it should just ignore this flag.
			\param[in,out] &inOut - a ConstraintInOut structure that is used to pass in information
			that the behavior will modify and then pass out.  The structure contains 4 parameters:
			\li vel: the newly calculated velocity of the delegate
			\li pos: the current position of the delegate
			\li speed: the current speed of the delegate
			\li desGoal: the current desired goal of the delegate\n
			The behavior may change one or all of these parameters.  Note that the
			next position that the delegate will be at is nextPos = pos + normalized(vel)*Speed.
			So changing the current position doesn't actually change where it is, but it just 
			changes the position that is used to calculate it's new position.  Usually the 
			behavior will change the velocity parameter, and it will only change the pos parameter
			if it needs to so that the Speed, and thus the energy of the delegate, doesn't change.
			Note that the velocity that you return should be normalized.
			\return 0 if the behavior isn't active for this particular delegate, or if the behavior, 
			for any reason, wishes to have no effect on the delegate at this time.  Otherwise, it returns 1.
