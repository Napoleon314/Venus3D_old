/*! \sa  Class Mesh, Class Matrix3, Class Point3.\n\n
\par Description:
Prior to release 3.0, developers could implement <b>Object::ApplyUVWMap()</b>
in their objects, but didn't have access to the algorithm 3ds Max uses
internally to turn the mapping types (MAP_BOX, MAP_PLANE, etc) into an actual
vertex-to-mapping-coordinate function. This class now makes this available.\n\n
The constructors for the class initialize the data members with information
about the mapping desired. The main method, <b>MapPoint()</b>, maps a point in
object space into the UVW map defined by this mapper.\n\n
Note: <b>typedef Point3 UVVert;</b>
\par Data Members:
<b>int type;</b>\n\n
The mapping type. One of the following values:\n\n
<b>MAP_PLANAR</b>\n\n
<b>MAP_CYLINDRICAL</b>\n\n
<b>MAP_SPHERICAL</b>\n\n
<b>MAP_BALL</b>\n\n
<b>MAP_BOX</b>\n\n
<b>MAP_FACE</b>\n\n
<b>int cap;</b>\n\n
This is used with <b>MAP_CYLINDRICAL</b>. If nonzero, then any face normal that
is pointing more vertically than horizontally will be mapped using planar
coordinates.\n\n
<b>float utile;</b>\n\n
Number of tiles in the U direction.\n\n
<b>float vtile;</b>\n\n
Number of tiles in the V direction.\n\n
<b>float wtile;</b>\n\n
Number of tiles in the W direction.\n\n
<b>int uflip;</b>\n\n
If nonzero the U values are mirrored.\n\n
<b>int vflip</b>\n\n
If nonzero the V values are mirrored.\n\n
<b>int wflip;</b>\n\n
If nonzero the W values are mirrored.\n\n
<b>Matrix3 tm;</b>\n\n
This defines the mapping space. As each point is mapped, it is multiplied by
this matrix, and then it is mapped.  */

	\par Parameters:
	<b>Point3 p</b>\n\n
	The location of a vertex, i.e. the point being mapped. This point should
	NOT be transformed by the UVWMapper's tm, as this happens internally.\n\n
	<b>const Point3 \& norm</b>\n\n
	The direction of the surface normal at p. This information is only required
	for types MAP_BOX or MAP_CYLINDRICAL. See the method <b>NormalMatters()</b>
	below.\n\n
	<b>int *nan=NULL</b>\n\n
	If non-NULL, this points to an int which should be set to FALSE if this
	mapping is good for all faces using this vertex, or TRUE if different faces
	should have different mapping coordinates. This is generally set to TRUE
	more often than absolutely necessary to make sure nothing is missed.
