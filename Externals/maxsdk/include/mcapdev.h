\par Description:
This is the base class for an input device plug-in. All methods of this class
are virtual.\n\n
In terms of the motion capture system, the basic item that is plug-able is the
motion capture device. This is something like a mouse, joystick, or midi
device. Developers implement two classes, this one, <b>MCInputDevice</b>, and
<b>MCDeviceBinding</b>. There is usually only one instance of
<b>MCInputDevice</b>. This is like the virtual mouse, or the joystick. This
represents the actual device. An instance of the device binding represents an
instance where a motion capture controller has been bound to a device, i.e. the
user has picked the device and assigned it to a parameter. Thus there may be
many instances of the device binding. The device binding is part of the
reference hierarchy. The device itself doesn't usually have any parameters for
the user to adjust -- these are rather part of the device binding.\n\n
Some simple sample code for the mouse motion capture device is available in
<b>/MAXSDK/SAMPLES/MOCAP/MCDEVICE.CPP</b>.  */

		virtual	void UtilityStopped(IMCapManager *im) {}
		/*! \remarks This method is called when the user is in 'Record'
		(capture) mode or 'Test' mode. It is called once per millisecond. For
		instance the joystick device uses this method. To understand this
		method consider the following example:\n\n
		With MIDI you don't call a function to see if a key has been pressed or
		not -- rather it is a message based system where you're notified if
		something happens. In contrast to this is the joystick. If the user
		moves the joystick the program is not notified. Rather a developer must
		poll the joystick to get its current position. During motion capture
		one could poll the joystick at every frame to get its current position.
		However this approach leads to jittering (aliasing). The problem is
		that, on average, the joystick is providing a smooth series of values,
		but instantaneously, the values jump around a bit. So, the joystick
		motion capture plug-in implements this method to stores the values
		returned at every millisecond. Then later, when needing to sample the
		joystick at a certain time, the stored table of values can be averaged
		and this provides a level of smoothing.
		\par Parameters:
		<b>UINT tick</b>\n\n
		The time of this call in milliseconds.

		<b>{}</b> */

		/*! \remarks This method is called 50 times per second during motion
		capture.\n\n
		To understand how this is used consider the following two situations
		for a motion capture device:\n\n
		1. The motion capture device is a joystick, and the position of
		the joystick directly maps to a range of some parameter. In this case,
		if you need to evaluate the parameter, you simply evaluate the joystick
		(inside the <b>Eval()</b> method). The position establishes the
		value.\n\n
		2. A different case is where you have a parameter at a starting
		value, and if the joystick is moved, to say the right, the value is
		incremented. If the joystick is moved to the left the value is
		decremented. In this case the value can theoretically reach any value.
		What is needed is for the value to be incremented and decremented in a
		consistent fashion. If the joystick is polled only during the
		<b>Eval()</b> method, and the value is incremented or decremented
		there, it may be a problem. If two things are using the same motion
		capture device, the value will be incremented or decremented twice
		inside <b>Eval()</b>. This will cause the value to grow or shrink twice
		as fast. If three things evaluated the same joystick it would move
		three times as fast because it would get incremented three times per
		frame. The solution is to use this method. It is called 50 times per
		second. The increments are done inside this method, and when the
		<b>Eval()</b> method is called the accumulated state is simply
		returned. This works because the method is called a fixed number of
		times per second regardless of the number of items evaluating the
		device.
		\par Parameters:
		<b>TimeValue t</b>\n\n
		The current time when this method is called.
