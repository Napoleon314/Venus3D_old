/********************************************************************************

  IPainterInterface contains all the interfaces to let a plugin interact with
  Maxs Paint system

  Basically the system consists of 2 components the IPainterInterface and IPainterCanvasInterface

  For a plugin to use the paint system it must sub class of IPainterCanvasInterface_V5 or greater 
  and implement the virtual methods and be a sub class of ReferenceTarget.  A canvas is what the 
  painterInterface paints on. Basically  IPainterCanvasInterface_V5 consists of functions to 
  identify the canvas version and functions that are called a as the system paints, basically a 
  start stroke, stroke and endstroke.

  The IPainterInterface is what does all the hit testing against the mesh using a quad tree.  
  Basically it tells the canvas what the stroke looks like.  In addition the canvas can use it
  do additional hit testing not associated with a stroke.

  In its simplest from all that needs to be done is
  
	1.  Subclass your plugin from IPainterCanvasInterface_V5 and ReferenceTarget
	2.  Fill out these virtual methods

		StartStroke() - called when a stroke is started
		PaintStroke()/PaintStroke(<..>) - called as a stroke is going on
		EndStroke() - called when the stroke ends and accepted.
		EndStroke(<...>) - called when the system is set to non interactive mode.
		CancelStroke() - called if a stroke is canceled.
		SystemEndPaintSession() - is called when the painter wants to end a paint session for some reason
		See the header for me description of the parameters

        You also need to add the painter interface to the GetInterface method from ReferenceTarget.  
		Something along the lines below.  This lets the painter set what interfaces the canvas supports.
			
			  void* PainterTester::GetInterface(ULONG id)
				{
				switch(id)
					{
					case PAINTERCANVASINTERFACE_V5 : return (IPainterCanvasInterface_V5 *) this;
						break;
					default: return ReferenceTarget::GetInterface(id);
					break;
					}
				}



    3.  In addition to implementing these methods, The plugin needs to hook up to 
	    the painterInterface.  Using these functions.  The pointer to the painter 
		can be gotten by using the CreateInstance(REF_TARGET_CLASS_ID,PAINTERINTERFACE_CLASS_ID). 
		Once that pointer is gotten you need to grab a specific version of the painterInterface
		using GetPaintInterface.   See sample below

	
			ReferenceTarget *painterRef = (ReferenceTarge *) GetCOREInterface()->CreateInstance(REF_TARGET_CLASS_ID,PAINTERINTERFACE_CLASS_ID);	
//set it to the correct verion
			if (painterRef)			
				IPainterInterface_V5 *painter = (IPainterInterface_V5 *) painterRef->GetInterface(PAINTERINTERFACE_V5);

		Once you have a valid pointer you need to hook your self up to the Painter using the
		InitializeCallback method.  This is should be done just before you want to start a paint seesion.
		All you are doing is passing a pointer of yourself to the painter system so it knows where 
		to send the messages.  Note yourself to IPainterCanvasInterface	since the Painter will 
		interogate you to find out which version of the canvas you are.

			painter->InitializeCallback((ReferenceTarget *) this);

		Once you have called InitializedCallback and are ready to start a paint session you need load up which 
		Nodes you want to paint on.  This is done with InitializeNodes(int flags, Tab<INode*> &nodeList).

				painter->InitializeNodes(0, nodes);

		Then StartPaintSession() is called.  Once this is called everytime the the users drag paints across
		the nodes the Canvas's StartStroke/PaintStroke/EndStroke will get called.
		
				painter->StartPaintSession();

		If the canvas changes the topology or geometry of the painted nodes UpdateMeshes() needs to be called
		so the quad tree gets updated.

				painter->UpdateMeshes(BOOL updatePoitnCache);

		
		Once the canvas is done with the painter it needs to call EndPaintSession() so that all the data can
		be freed and it can be unhooked.  Otherwise the StartStroke/PaintStroke/EndStroke will still be called.

				painter->EndPaintSession();

		You can also bring up the Painters Option dialog using the BringUpOptions().

				painter->BringUpOptions() ;

		In addition there will be some helper functions for gathering points within a stroke and their weigths; and 
		tools for intersecting rays against the quad tree.  See the header for more descriptions.


		See the PaintTester project for a simple implementation of a canvas and interaction with the painter.
