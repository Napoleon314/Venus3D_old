/*!
 * \brief Path type - adds path-operation richness over symbol strings.
 *
 * The Path interface provides operations for path composition (Append and 
 * Prepend) and decomposition (StripToParent, StripToChild, RemoveParent, 
 * RemoveChild), query methods for determining information about a Path,
 * such as whether it's absolute, relative, a root or a UNC, and finally,
 * quick conversions from relative to absolute or absolute to relative.
 *
 * Note paths are automatically kept in a standard form, where:
 * \li all slashes '/' are converted to backslashes '\\'.
 * \li multiple backslashes in a row are collapsed down to one - '\\\\\\' becomes 
 *    '\\'
 *
 * Normalization is a separate, explicit method that must be called by the 
 * client.  Normalization removes null directories '\\\.\\' and adds in any missing
 * backslash after the drive letter. Wherever possible, normalization will 
 * resolve out any ".." path components so: "r:\\dirA\\dirB\\..\\dirC" becomes 
 * "r:\\dirA\\dirC."  If these hit the root, they just get stripped off, so 
 * "r:\\.." normalizes to "r:\\" If the path is relative, and there are more ".."s
 *  than preceding directories, * the extra sets are kept at the start of the 
 * path: "b\\..\\..\\c" becomes "..\\c"  Any trailing backslash is kept on the path
 * for compatibility with many win32 API functions.  If a uniform 
 * trailing-backslash format is desired, for example, for display in the UI, it
 * is up to client-level code to implement this policy. Unresolved symbols are 
 * left intact during normalization.  Resolving the symbols in a string
 * normalizes automatically.
 *
 * To reiterate, normalization as performed by the Normalize() method is 
 * different from the basic standard form maintained by all members of Path.
 * The client must call Normalize() explicitly (or ResolveSymbols() which is 
 * the only method that calls Normalize() automatically).  The reason that these
 * are kept separate is to keep from radically modifying a path in a way that
 * may be surprising to a user.  If the user wishes to construt a path with 
 * many '..\\'s in it, the user will expect to see this result.  Normalize()
 * may then be called subsequently when it is deemed appropriate.
 * 
 * To illustrate the difference:
 * \li "/a/b/c/./../" is neither in standard form nor normalized.
 * \li "\\a\b\\c\\.." and "\\a\b\\c\\." are in standard form but not normalized.
 * \li "\\a\b" and "\\a\b\\c" are both in standard form and normalized.
