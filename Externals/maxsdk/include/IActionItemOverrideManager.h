class ActionItem;

//! \brief Class used to specify action item overrides.

//! The IActionItemOverride class is an abstract base class to be used to create an action item override. An action item override is 
//! an action item that will only execute as long as the action item keyboard shortcut is held. Once released the override will revert back to the state it
//! was in before the action item executed.  In order for an override to occur instead of an action item, the client needs to create an 
//! instance of a class that implements the virtual functions defined in this base class, and then activate it by
//! calling IActionItemOverrideManager::ActivateActionItemOverride.  
//! \see IActionItemOverrideManager
