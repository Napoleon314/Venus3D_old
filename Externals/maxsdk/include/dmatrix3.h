/*! Class DPoint3, ~{ Matrix Representations of 3D Transformations }~, Class Quat,  Class AngAxis, Structure AffineParts, Class BigMatrix.\n\n
Description:
This class implements a 4x3 3D transformation matrix object. Methods are
provided to zero the matrix, set it to the identity, compute its inverse, apply
incremental translation, rotation and scaling, and build new X, Y and Z
rotation matrices. Operators are provided for matrix addition, subtraction, and
multiplication. All methods are implemented by the system.\n\n
Note: In 3ds Max, all vectors are assumed to be row vectors. Under this
assumption, multiplication of a vector with a matrix can be written either way
(Matrix*Vector or Vector*Matrix), for ease of use, and the result is the same
-- the (row) vector transformed by the matrix.
Data Members:
private:\n\n
double m[4][3];\n\n
Matrix storage.\n\n
DWORD flags;\n\n
Matrix Identity Flags.\n\n
POS_IDENT\n\n
Indicates the translation row of the matrix is the identity.\n\n
ROT_IDENT\n\n
Indicates the rotation elements of the matrix are the identity.\n\n
SCL_IDENT\n\n
Indicates the scale elements of the matrix are the identity.\n\n
MAT_IDENT\n\n
Indicates the matrix is the identity matrix. This is equivalent to
(POS_IDENT|ROT_IDENT|SCL_IDENT).\n\n
