	/*! \remarks Implemented by the System.\n\n
	Normally this is NOT needed but in special cases this can be useful.
	This allows a developer to group a set of Begin()/Accept() sequences to
	be undone in one operation.\n\n
	Consider the case of the user using the Shift-Move command to create a
	new node in the scene. There are two parts to this process. First the
	node must be cloned and second the position must be tracked as the user
	moves the mouse to place the new node in the scene. Naturally if the
	user wanted to Undo this operation, they would expect a single
	selection of the Undo command would accomplish it. However the process
	was not a single operation. There was the initial cloning of the node,
	and then the iterative process of moving the node in the scene,
	restoring its position, moving it again, restoring it again, etc. Cases
	like this are handled using methods of <b>theHold</b> named
	<b>SuperBegin(), SuperAccept()</b> and <b>SuperCancel()</b>. These
	allow the developer to group several restore objects together so that
	they may be undone via a single selection of Undo. Note that in this
	example it is only necessary to use <b>SuperBegin()</b> and
	<b>SuperAccept()</b> because the move was restoring interactively.
	Normally a developer does NOT need to use these methods even if they
	have several operations that modify the database. The undo system will
	automatically register all the restore objects needed as part of the
	undo object when <b>theHold.Accept()</b> is called and these may be
	undone using a single UNDO command.
