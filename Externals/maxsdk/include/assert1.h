/*! \defgroup AssertMacros Assert macros
 * The following macros can be used in 3ds Max plug-ins to assert assumptions made by the plug-in's code.
 * Asserts are always enabled in Debug and Hybrid builds, and by default are disabled
 * in release builds. They can be enabled in release builds of a plug-in by defining 
 * the MAX_ASSERTS_ACTIVE_IN_RELEASE_BUILD pre-processor symbol. 
 * One way to do this is: set CL=/DMAX_ASSERTS_ACTIVE_IN_RELEASE_BUILD
 *
 * All assert macros below are equivalent. The 32 and 64 bit versions of these macros are also equivalent.
 * The reason why several macros exist are historical...
 * Plug-ins are encouraged to use the DbgAssert macro.
 * 
 * Code that needs to be compiled only when asserts are active (enabled) can be 
 * conditionaly defined using MAX_ASSERT_ACTIVE. One example when this can be useful is when 
 * certain variables are used for debugging purposes only. In this case they can be conditionally
 * declared and updated based on the MAX_ASSERT_ACTIVE symbol, and can be part of expressions that
 * are evaluated in asserts.
 * \code
 * #ifdef MAX_ASSERT_ACTIVE
 * int counter = 0;
 * // update counter
 * #endif
 * DbgAssert(counter != 0);
 * \endcode
