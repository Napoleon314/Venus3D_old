	This template class is a generic, dynamic array container, similar to the
	STL class "vector". Whereas the classical 3ds Max SDK class Tab supports
	only POD types, this class supports non-POD types as well.
	\note POD stands for "plain old data", and basically denotes any data type which 
	does not need to be constructed, destructed, and which can be copied with 
	memcpy() rather than requiring a copy operator to be called.
