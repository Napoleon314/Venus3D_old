//!\brief Interface for setting parameters in a compiled effect file.
/*! A IRTShaderNode would implement this new interface to allow setting of parameters to the underlying
graphics subsystem.  When a shade tree is created a Microsoft Effect file is generated that contains all 
the parameters exposed during compiling of the tree.  At runtime the subsystem needs to set values to these
parameters.  At this level it knows nothing about the underlying material structure, and simply has a bunch
parameter names and data types.  To aid this, at render time the hardware renderer will query the host for the 
IRTShaderParameterBinding interface, and will call BindParameter to have the data assigned to the effect frame
work.  The "value" passed to the method is the correct size for the underlying data type, so the BindParameter
method must understand the data request.  In general this would either be a float, or a D3DXVECTOR (or D3DCOLORVALUE)
type for colors.  This value is assigned directly to the effect framework.
An example of setting a value can be seen below - taken from the Architectural and Design Material

\code
if(_tcscmp(paramName,_M("mia_material_1_diffuse"))==0)
{
	AColor val;
	val = m_mainPB->GetAColor(kPar_Diffuse, t);
	*(D3DCOLORVALUE*)value = GetD3DColor(val);
}
\endcode
This checks the name of the parameter, accesses the correct data item from the paramblock, and sets the
value correctly.
