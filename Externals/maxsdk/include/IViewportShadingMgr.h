//! Viewport manager to control general illumination, including shadow support in the viewport
/*! New to 3ds Max 2008, the IViewportShadingMgr gives access to the new viewport Shading feature.
The viewports have been redesigned to support more realistic rendering including Shadows.  The interface also 
provides access to various flags that control how lights are used in the viewport.  This is used closely with 
the new INodeShadingProperites API, that manages the actual flags set by IViewportShadingMgr
The developer can get access to the CORE interface by using
\code
IViewportShadingMgr * pShaderMgr = GetIViewportShadingMgr();
\endcode
