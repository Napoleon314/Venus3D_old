		 * This function changes the way the messages are sent based on the sequence of mouse

		 * The normal flow of the messages is described as follows: First the user clicks the 
		 * mouse button and a MOUSE_POINT message is generated. The user then drags the
		 * mouse with the button down, resulting in a series of MOUSE_MOVE messages
		 * to be sent. When the user releases the mouse button, a MOUSE_POINT
		 * messages is generated. Then the mouse is moved again, resulting in a new series of
		 * MOUSE_MOVE messages to be sent again. Unlike the first time, when the user 
		 * clicks the mouse button here, a point message is NOT generated at this point until the button
		 * is released. All future points are then only sent after the mouse
		 * button has been pressed and released. The default implementation is 
		 * { return mode; }, and a sample program using the override method 
		 * (using CLICK_DOWN_POINT) can be found in 
		   /MAXSDK/SAMPLES/OBJECTS/SPLINE.CPP.

		/**	Transform Gizmo Interface. Returns TRUE if the mouse proc 
		 * supports a transform gizmo, FALSE if not.
		 * This method and DeactivateTransformGizmo() are normally
		 * implemented by the selection processor and the existing mouse procs.
		 * However, special implementation is possible as well. For that,
		 * because the transform gizmo depends on the Command Mode, the
		 * MouseCallback itself decides if it supports the use of the transform
		 * gizmo or not. When the node axis (or transform gizmo) is redrawn, the system
		 * will ask the command mode's mouse proc whether or not it supports transform gizmos.
		 * If it does, it will draw a gizmo instead of the regular node axis.
		 * The same procedure happens with the main selection processor in 3ds Max.
		 * When the mouse is moved, the selection processor itself asks if the
		 * MouseCallback supports transform gizmos or not. If so, it will hit
		 * test the gizmo in a MOUSE_FREEMOVE or MOUSE_POINT message. If any of 
		 * the transform gizmos hit test flags are passed into
		 * the mouse procs hit tester, the transform gizmo should be hit tested as
		 * well (using Interface::HitTestTransformGizmo()). The default Implementation
		 * of this function is {return FALSE;}.
		 * When hit testing the gizmo, different flags will be passed in:
		 * \li HIT_TRANSFORMGIZMO is passed in on a MOUSE_FREEMOVE
		 * message so that the axis is hit tested and it highlights if it is hit,
		 * but it doesn't actually switch the transform mode.
		 * \li In case of a MOUSE_POINT, the flag will be HIT_SWITCH_GIZMO, 
		 * and if the axis is hit, the 'hit' transform mode will be pushed on the 
		 * transform mode stack.
		 * \li When the mouse is released (MOUSE_POINT, pt==1 or MOUSE_ABORT), 
		 * then the axis constraint should pop back to the
		 * existing one, and DeactivateTransformGizmo() is called. Inside
		 * DeactivateTransformGizmo() the normal implementation is to pop
		 * the axis mode back. It should also maintain a flag (set it if
		 * HitTestTransformGizmo() returns TRUE and the HIT_SWITCH_GIZMO is set, 
		 * and clear it in DeactivateTransformGizmo()). The flag is needed because you
		 * should not call Interface::PopAxisMode() unless the axis mode
		 * was previously popped. */
